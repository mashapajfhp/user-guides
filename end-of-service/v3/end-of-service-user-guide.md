### How End of Service Fits

End of Service is a **transaction calculator** that computes final settlement amounts when employees depart. It pulls data from payroll, leave records, and contract information to generate compliant settlement documents.

<div class="info-box">

**Mental model:** Departure Trigger → Gratuity + Leave Encashment + Deductions → Settlement Document → Payroll Processing

</div>

Calculations follow UAE labor law requirements with gratuity caps and formulas based on years of service and contract type.

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Key Decisions Before Setup

Answer these questions before processing end of service:

- **Contract type?** — Unlimited or Limited affects gratuity formula
- **Departure reason?** — Termination, Resignation, or End of Contract
- **Leave balance?** — Verify accrued leave for encashment calculation
- **Deductions needed?** — Any outstanding loans or advances to deduct?

</div>

</div>

<div id="feature-usage" class="section section">

## Feature Usage

### Common Workflows

<div class="feature-grid">

<div class="feature-card">

#### Processing Employee Resignation

When an employee resigns, navigate to their profile, select "Resignation" as the departure reason, enter the last working day, and calculate the final settlement including gratuity and leave encashment.

</div>

<div class="feature-card">

#### Handling Contract Expiration

For limited contract employees whose contracts are ending, select "End of Contract" as the reason, enter the contract end date, and process the settlement calculation.

</div>

<div class="feature-card">

#### Processing Termination

When terminating an employee, select "Termination" as the departure reason, enter the effective termination date, and calculate the final settlement with all applicable components.

</div>

</div>

### Usage Examples

<div class="info-box">

**Example 1: Calculating Gratuity for a 6-Year Employee**

An employee with 6 years of service and a basic salary of AED 5,000 is resigning. <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="14243037048465">For service over 5 years, the gratuity is calculated using a mixed formula: 21 days' basic salary for the first 5 years plus 30 days' basic salary for each additional year, with a maximum cap of two years' basic salary</span>. The system automatically applies the correct formula based on the departure date entered.

</div>

<div class="info-box">

**Example 2: Leave Encashment Calculation**

An employee has 15 unused leave days at departure. <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-2958">The system calculates the monetary value of these days using the configured leave proration method. The leave days calculation display shows how many days are eligible for encashment based on the selected calculation method</span>. <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-2605">The calculation uses the daily wage formula: (basic salary + allowances) / 30</span> and adds this to the End of Service settlement.

</div>

<div class="info-box">

**Example 3: Amount Consistency Across System**

<span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-1099">End of Service amounts are consistent across all system views. The gratuity and settlement amounts shown in the EOS tab match exactly with what appears in the transaction page and the payroll table, ensuring data integrity throughout the offboarding process</span>.

</div>

### Reports and Export Options

#### Gratuity Reports with Date Range Selection

<span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-772">Gratuity reports support date range selection, allowing you to generate reports for specific time periods. The interface provides a date range selector for custom start and end dates, as well as a monthly granularity option to generate monthly gratuity liability reports instead of annual summaries</span>.

#### Custom Report Builder Integration

<span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-2725">The Gratuity field is available in the custom payroll report builder, allowing you to create customized reports that include End of Service data. Note that gratuity values only populate in custom reports for employees who have completed EOS processing</span>.

#### Accrual Reports

<span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-1527">Historical accrual reports are accessible for all closed payroll cycles. The accrual report interface displays a payroll cycle selector showing all available closed periods, not just the most recent one. This allows you to track gratuity liability over time</span>.

<span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-2211">Accrual report column headers clearly distinguish between "Accrual up to previous payroll cycle close" and "Total accrual amount at end of payroll cycle". Tooltips are available on column headers to explain the timing and meaning of accrual calculations</span>.

<span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-2382">Accrual balances maintain continuity from month to month, with each report showing how the balance carries forward from the previous closed period. New hires are handled appropriately in accrual reports based on their hire date and eligibility</span>.

#### Report Field Options

<span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-2003">Gratuity reports include additional field options such as "Days of Service" and filters for GCC nationality, allowing you to segment and analyze your gratuity liability by different employee attributes</span>.

### Understanding Gratuity Calculations

<span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-3123">The system provides calculation transparency through help text and expandable breakdown dialogs that explain the gratuity methodology</span>. Key calculation formulas:

<div class="feature-card">

#### Service Duration Calculation

<span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-4496">Total Service Duration = Gross Service Duration - Unpaid Leave Days</span>

The system displays both the gross service duration (from hire date to departure date) and separately lists any unpaid leave deductions to show the net service period used for gratuity calculation.

</div>

<div class="feature-card">

#### Daily Wage Calculation

<span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-2605">Daily Wage = (Basic Salary + Allowances) / 30</span>

This formula is used for calculating both gratuity and leave encashment. The calculation breakdown shows this formula to ensure transparency in how amounts are derived.

</div>

<div class="feature-card">

#### Gratuity Formula (Service \< 5 Years)

Gratuity = (Basic Salary ÷ 30) × 21 × Years of Service

For employees with less than 5 years of continuous service, 21 days of basic salary per year of service.

</div>

<div class="feature-card">

#### Gratuity Formula (Service ≥ 5 Years)

Gratuity = \[(Basic Salary ÷ 30) × 21 × 5\] + \[(Basic Salary ÷ 30) × 30 × (Years - 5)\]

For employees with 5 or more years of service: 21 days per year for the first 5 years + 30 days per year for each additional year. Maximum cap: 2 years of basic salary.

</div>

<div class="feature-card">

#### Pro-rated Monthly Pay

<span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-2605">Pro-rated Pay = (Basic Salary + Allowances) / Days in Month × Days Worked</span>

Monthly pay components are pro-rated based on the number of days worked in the departure month, with consistent decimal precision to avoid rounding errors.

</div>

### Best Practices

- Always verify the hiring date is correct before calculating End of Service. <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-4206">Note that the hiring date field is locked once payroll transactions exist</span>
- Double-check the departure date to ensure accurate service duration calculation
- Review gratuity calculations carefully, especially for employees with over 5 years of service. <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-3123">Use the gratuity breakdown dialog to verify the calculation methodology</span>
- Ensure all leave balances are finalized before processing End of Service. <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-2958">Verify that the leave calculation method is configured correctly for your organization</span>
- Document any additions or deductions with clear reference numbers and notes
- Review the final settlement amount with the employee before submission when possible. <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-1099">Verify that amounts match across the EOS tab, transaction page, and payroll table</span>
- Keep printed settlement documents for compliance and audit purposes. <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-1887">Downloaded gratuity files include clear month identification for proper record-keeping</span>
- For employees outside the UAE, confirm that the system correctly shows zero gratuity per UAE law. <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-1026">Currency settings persist during offboarding to ensure consistency</span>
- Wait until the payroll period is closed before attempting to submit the final EOS transaction

<div class="info-box">

**Note:** No pre-configured End of Service workflows exist in the system. Organizations can create custom workflows using the available triggers to automate their offboarding processes.

</div>

### Best Practices for EOS Workflows

- Use the "Employee offboarding process is initiated" trigger for pre-departure tasks (equipment collection, access revocation)
- Use the "Employee is offboarded" trigger for post-departure tasks (final notifications, record updates)
- Include relevant employee data in email templates for personalized communications
- Test workflows with a small group before rolling out to the entire organization
- Document all active workflows for audit and compliance purposes

## Business Rules & Limitations

### Core Business Rules

<span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="18272729992977">End of Service calculations follow specific rules based on employee contract type, departure reason, and UAE labor law requirements</span>.

| Business Rule | Details | Impact |
|----|----|----|
| Gratuity Eligibility | <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="14243037048465">Minimum 1 year of continuous service required for gratuity eligibility</span> | Employees with less than 1 year service receive no gratuity |
| Non-AED Currency Rule | <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="18272729992977">Non-AED employees receive 0 gratuity per UAE law</span> | Only AED-based employees are eligible for gratuity calculation |
| Gratuity Calculation Formula | <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="14243037048465">Different formulas apply for service periods under 5 years versus over 5 years of service</span> | Calculation method changes based on tenure duration |
| Gratuity Maximum Cap | <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="14243037048465">Gratuity capped at maximum of two years' basic salary</span> | Calculated gratuity cannot exceed two years of basic salary |
| Contract Type Handling | <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="18272729992977">Different handling for limited and unlimited contract types</span> | Contract type selection affects calculation methodology |
| Variable Pay Visibility | <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="18272729992977">Variable pay and work expenses not shown for future departure dates</span> | Future-dated calculations exclude variable compensation components |
| Unpaid Leave Exclusion | <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="14243037048465">Unpaid leave days are excluded from service calculation</span>. <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-3842">Leave policies can be configured to exclude unpaid leave from service duration, and the calculation breakdown shows the deduction separately</span> | Service duration is reduced by any unpaid leave periods |
| Departure Reason Options | <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="18272729992977">Valid reasons include Termination, Resignation, or End of contract</span> | Departure reason must be selected from predefined list |
| Payroll Period Closure | Final EOS transaction submission is only available after the payroll period containing the departure date is closed | Prevents premature submission and ensures all payroll data is finalized before settlement |
| Hiring Date Lock | <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-4206">Hiring date field becomes read-only and locked when employee has payroll transaction history</span> | Prevents modification of hiring date that would invalidate historical payroll calculations |
| EOS Tab Visibility | <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-1377">EOS tab is visible for active employees and disabled/hidden for offboarded employees</span> | Prevents changes to completed settlements after employee offboarding |
| Calculation Transparency | <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-3123">Gratuity calculation methodology is accessible through help text and breakdown dialogs, with editable fields for manual adjustments</span> | Allows users to understand and verify calculation logic |

### System Constraints

- <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="18272729992977">Variable pay and work expenses are not predictable for future months, limiting accuracy of forward-looking calculations</span>
- Gratuity calculations are based solely on basic salary, not gross salary or allowances
- The system requires manual entry of departure date, reason, and contract type—these cannot be auto-populated from other modules
- Leave encashment calculations depend on accurate leave balance data in the system
- Historical data for past departures may not be available for recalculation or audit purposes

### Compliance Requirements

All End of Service calculations must comply with UAE labor law as administered by the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MOHRE). Key compliance points include:

- <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="14243037048465">Calculations must follow MOHRE-mandated formulas based on years of service and basic salary</span>
- <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-1026">Gratuity must be calculated and paid in AED currency per UAE labor law (not KSA or other GCC regulations)</span>
- Final settlement documents should be retained for audit and compliance verification
- All deductions and additions must be documented with clear justification
- <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-1099">Settlement amounts must be consistent across all system interfaces (EOS tab, transaction page, payroll table)</span>

## Troubleshooting & Edge Cases

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|----|----|----|
| Gratuity amount shows as zero | Employee is non-AED currency or has less than 1 year service | Verify employee currency setting and service duration. Non-AED employees are not eligible for gratuity under UAE law. |
| Leave encashment not calculating | Leave balance data may be missing or inaccurate in the system | Check employee leave balances in the Time-Off module before calculating End of Service. Ensure leave policies are correctly configured. |
| Variable pay not appearing in calculation | <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="18272729992977">Variable pay is not shown for future departure dates</span> | If calculating for a future date, variable pay components will not be included. Use actual departure date for complete calculation. |
| Gratuity calculation differs from expected amount | Contract type or service duration may be incorrectly selected | Verify contract type (Unlimited vs Limited) and confirm total service duration. Review calculation formula for the applicable service period. |
| Cannot modify gratuity or leave amounts | Fields may be locked after initial calculation | Check if the settlement has been submitted. You may need to create a new calculation to make changes. |
| Deductions not saving | Deduction type or amount may be invalid | Verify deduction details are complete with reference number and notes. Ensure amount does not exceed total settlement. |
| Cannot submit EOS transaction | Payroll period containing departure date is not yet closed | Wait until the payroll cycle is closed. System will display message: "Submitting this transaction is available once the payroll period \[dates\] is closed" |
| Hiring date field is locked and cannot be modified | <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-4206">Hiring date becomes read-only when employee has existing payroll transaction history</span> | This is by design to maintain payroll data integrity. If the hiring date is incorrect, contact support to resolve the issue before processing EOS. |
| EOS tab not visible or disabled | <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-1377">Employee may already be offboarded, or you may lack necessary permissions</span> | Verify employee status in the system. EOS tab is automatically disabled after offboarding to prevent changes to completed settlements. |
| Calculation breakdown not showing details | <span class="citation" source="jira" ref="TSSD-2605">Daily wage calculation details may not be immediately visible</span> | Look for the breakdown dialog or expandable section showing the formula: (basic + allowances) / 30. Click the gratuity amount to view the detailed calculation breakdown. |

### Edge Cases

<div class="info-box warning">

**Important:** <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="18272729992977">Gratuity can be edited and leave encashments can be modified after initial calculation</span>. Always review these adjustments carefully before final submission.

</div>

The following scenarios require special attention:

- **Leap Year Calculations:** <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="14243037048465">Leap years require calculation using 366 days instead of 365</span>. Ensure the system correctly accounts for leap years in service duration calculations.
- **Partial Year Service:** Employees with less than 12 months of service are not eligible for gratuity. The system should display zero gratuity for these cases.
- **Multiple Contract Changes:** If an employee has had both limited and unlimited contracts, clarify which contract type applies at the time of departure.
- **Unpaid Leave Periods:** <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="14243037048465">Unpaid leave days are excluded from service calculation</span>. Verify any unpaid leave is properly deducted from total service duration.
- **Recurring Deductions:** <span class="citation" source="zendesk" ref="18272729992977">The system allows ability to add one-off or recurring deductions</span>. Ensure recurring deductions are not duplicated if the employee has already departed.
- **Currency Conversion:** Non-AED employees will show zero gratuity. Confirm this is the intended behavior per UAE labor law before finalizing settlement.

### Frequently Asked Questions

<div class="faq-accordion">

How is gratuity calculated under UAE labor law?

<div class="faq-answer">

For unlimited contracts: 21 days of basic salary per year for the first 5 years, then 30 days per year thereafter. For limited contracts, different rules apply based on reason for departure. The system automatically applies the correct formula based on contract type and departure reason.

</div>

What's included in the end-of-service settlement?

<div class="faq-answer">

The settlement includes: gratuity payment, leave encashment for unused vacation days, any pending salary, and deductions for outstanding loans or advances. Each component is itemized in the settlement breakdown.

</div>

Can I calculate gratuity for an employee who hasn't left yet?

<div class="faq-answer">

Yes. Use the Gratuity Liability Report to calculate projected gratuity for all active employees. This helps with financial planning and provisioning without processing an actual departure.

</div>

Why is the leave encashment amount different from expected?

<div class="faq-answer">

Leave encashment uses the Daily Wage Calculator settings. Check Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculator to verify which salary component and days calculation method is configured for end-of-service leave encashment.

</div>

How do I add deductions to the final settlement?

<div class="faq-answer">

During the EOS calculation process, you can add manual deductions such as outstanding loans, advances, or other amounts owed. These are subtracted from the final settlement total before payment.
