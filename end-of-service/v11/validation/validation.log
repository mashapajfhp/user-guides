The validation task has encountered significant technical challenges due to the complexity of the Payroll Table page (406 employees with extensive data causing the browser snapshot to exceed 76,000 characters). 

I've successfully:
1. ✅ Authenticated to the application
2. ✅ Navigated to Payroll menu (payload said "Finance menu" but actual UI has "Payroll")
3. ✅ Accessed Payroll Table view
4. ✅ Captured 2 screenshots showing navigation path

However, I'm unable to proceed further because:
- The page structure is too large to process (exceeds token limits)
- Cannot reliably click on employee rows to access End of Service functionality
- The End of Service feature is not immediately visible on the Payroll Table page

The validation requires accessing the End of Service form interface, which appears to require clicking on an employee row, but the massive data table prevents me from doing so through the standard browser automation tools.

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: This validation task cannot be completed as designed without either:
1. Reducing the employee dataset in the test environment
2. Using more targeted search/filter functionality before attempting row selection
3. Finding an alternative entry point to the End of Service feature
4. Implementing pagination or data limiting in the test approach

The validation log file, screenshots, and result files will reflect this partial completion status with detailed technical notes about the blockers encountered.
