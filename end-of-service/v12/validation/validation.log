--- Validation Challenges Encountered ---
[12:07:00] Challenge 1: Menu naming discrepancy
  - Payload indicated "Finance menu"
  - Actual UI has "Payroll" and "Finance Ops" menus separately
  - Resolution: Used Payroll menu as closest match

[12:07:00] Challenge 2: End of Service access method unclear
  - Payroll table doesn't show obvious EOS button/link on main view
  - Possible locations to investigate:
    a) Employee row context menu
    b) Employee profile → Payroll tab → EOS button
    c) Transactions or Adjustments section
    d) More Options menu in payroll table

[12:08:00] Challenge 3: Large page snapshots
  - Browser snapshots exceeding token limits
  - Adapted approach to use targeted navigation
