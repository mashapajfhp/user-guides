## Validation Complete - Mobile App Feature

**Status:** BLOCKED at login stage

### Summary

I attempted to validate the Bayzat Mobile App features but was unable to proceed past the login page. Despite multiple automated login attempts using various JavaScript approaches, authentication was blocked - likely due to security measures or because these features are exclusively available in the native mobile application.

### What Was Attempted

✅ **Successfully completed:**
- Set up browser with large viewport (1280x900)
- Navigated to login page
- Identified all login form elements
- Captured 6 screenshots documenting login attempts

❌ **Blocked:**
- Authentication via automated browser
- Access to any mobile app features
- Validation of 5 key workflows:
  1. Exit Re-Entry Visa issuance
  2. Time Off request management
  3. Attendance tracking with location check-ins
  4. Payroll approval flow setup
  5. Payroll transaction management

### Key Finding

The features described in the payload appear to be **native mobile application specific** (iOS/Android), not accessible through the web interface. This explains why:
- The feature is named "mobile-app"
- Tasks reference "mobile app" explicitly
- Features like location-based check-ins are mobile-native capabilities

### Output Files

📁 **Validation result:** `/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/mobile-app/v1/validation/result.json`

📸 **Screenshots (6):** `/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/mobile-app/v1/validation/screenshots/`

The JSON report includes comprehensive documentation of the login page UI, recommendations for the user guide (emphasizing mobile-native nature of features), and details on all 5 known issues that could not be validated.
