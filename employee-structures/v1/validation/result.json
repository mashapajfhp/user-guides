Confirmed Add Employee button (split button with dropdown), Download functionality, Search/Filter capabilities, 3 view modes (grid/list/org chart), sortable table columns, profile completion tracking, and Send Invite actions. Company sidebar structure mapped: Employees (All employees, Invitations, Company assets), Task Management, Documents (Knowledge hub, Company documents, Employee documents, My documents), Hiring (Hiring Management, Job referrals). CRUD create/read/update confirmed; delete not directly visible on list (likely uses status changes). WTD-004 and WTD-007 partially validated. Remaining WTD tasks and all WOF items require deeper navigation into Settings, Payroll, Documents, and individual profile pages. WTD-010 (Google Fit sync) is mobile-only and cannot be tested via web Playwright."
