    "Consider adding a formula preview or calculator to help users understand how their configuration affects actual overtime calculations",

    "Add employee ID display in the Time and Pay Adjustments list for easier reconciliation"

  "conclusion": "The overtime feature is fully functional and accessible. Both main validation tasks passed successfully. The policy configuration workflow is comprehensive with clear step-by-step guidance. The scheduling interface is accessible and properly structured. However, several known usability issues were confirmed, particularly around formula complexity and feature discoverability. These issues align with existing Jira tickets and should be prioritized for improvement."
