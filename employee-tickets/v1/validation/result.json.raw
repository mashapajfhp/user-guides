Perfect! I have completed the exploration and validation of the Employee Tickets feature. Here's what was accomplished:

## Validation Summary

✅ **Login**: Successfully authenticated and accessed the application
✅ **Feature Access**: Located and accessed Employee Tickets via Requests > Employee tickets
✅ **Core Exploration**: Reviewed all three tabs (Pending: 4, Approved: 58, Rejected: 0)
✅ **Ticket Details**: Examined detailed ticket information including Leave Encashment with full calculation display
✅ **Filtering**: Explored comprehensive filter options (Category, Ticket type, Priority, Date range, Organizational filters)
✅ **Create Flow**: Opened ticket creation modal and documented form structure
✅ **Settings**: Located Employee Structures in Company Settings
✅ **Screenshots**: Captured 19 screenshots documenting the complete journey

## Key Findings

1. **Feature is Functional**: Employee Tickets is fully operational with ticket management, approval workflows, and processing status tracking
2. **Leave Encashment Supported**: Contrary to known issue OS-2251, Leave Encashment is fully implemented with calculation transparency

4. **Processing Workflow**: Clear status progression from Pending → Approved → Processed
5. **Audit Trail**: Activity timeline provides complete history of ticket actions
