  ],
  "summary": "Validation blocked at login stage. Despite multiple attempts using various JavaScript-based form interaction techniques, the Playwright automation tool could not successfully authenticate to the Bayzat application. The primary technical issue is that the Playwright MCP server's evaluate function consistently returns undefined instead of actual JavaScript execution results, making it impossible to verify actions or retrieve page state. Additionally, standard Playwright methods (fill, click) timeout when attempting to interact with form elements that are clearly visible in screenshots. The application also displays a 'You need to enable JavaScript to run this app' message, suggesting a potential incompatibility between the React application and the Playwright automation environment. Without successful authentication, no exploration of the Approval Flow feature could be conducted. Based on the validation payload documentation, the Approval Flow feature should allow configuration of multi-level approval workflows for modules like Leave, Expenses, and Payroll Transactions, with support for role-based approvers and conditional logic. Manual validation or alternative automation approaches are recommended.",
