Both test surveys saved as draft and confirmed in list view. Anonymous survey settings validated (On/Off toggle with participant awareness). Full Settings section explored: Survey period, Anonymous responses, Sharing content, Notifications & reminders (4 reminder intervals). Action menus validated by status: Draft (Duplicate, Delete draft) vs Completed (Duplicate, Re-open survey, Share results), confirming WOF-001 post-launch immutability. 7 templates available with estimated times. Engagement insights analytics validated (NPS: 66, 9 engagement categories, 60% response rate). NEW ISSUE DISCOVERED (WOF-003): Survey owner/publisher cannot view details for most completed surveys from employee My surveys view — 9 out of 10 surveys had no View results button; anonymity threshold hides results when < 3 respondents. 28 screenshots captured across all major flows."
