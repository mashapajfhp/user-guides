### How Surveys Fits

Surveys are transactional data collection tools that capture employee feedback at specific points in time. They exist independently from core HR records but can be filtered and analyzed using employee demographic data.

<div class="info-box">

**Mental model:** Curious about something → Create a Survey → Distribute to Employees → Collect Responses → Aggregate Insights → Take Action

</div>

One survey can reach all employees or targeted segments. Survey results are point-in-time snapshots that don't alter employee records but inform organizational decisions.

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Key Decisions Before Setup

Answer these questions before creating surveys:

- **What feedback do you need?** — Define specific objectives (engagement, satisfaction, NPS, pulse checks, 360 reviews, exit interviews)
- **Who should respond?** — Determine target audience — all employees, a specific department, role, location, or any targeted group
- **How will you ensure honest responses?** — Decide on anonymity settings (anonymous responses hidden for groups under 3 employees)
- **How will you act on results?** — Plan follow-up actions to avoid survey fatigue and maintain trust

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Related Features

- **Employee Records** — Provides demographic data (department, gender, location) for survey segmentation and analysis
- **Performance Management** — Engagement survey data may inform performance decisions and 360 review processes
- **Notification System** — Distributes surveys and sends reminders to non-responders via email and push notifications
- **Reporting & Analytics** — Enables trend visualization, heatmaps, and downloadable Excel reports of survey results
- **Mobile App** — Allows employees to complete surveys on mobile devices with draft-saving capability

</div>

<div class="subsection">

<div id="initial-setup" class="section section section-initial-setup">

<div class="section-header">

## Initial Setup

</div>

<div class="section-body">

<div class="subsection">

### First-Time Configuration

Before creating your first survey, complete these foundational setup tasks to ensure optimal survey management and data collection.

#### 1. Define Survey Strategy

- Identify survey types needed (engagement, NPS, pulse, satisfaction, exit, 360 reviews)
- Determine survey frequency (weekly pulse, quarterly engagement, annual satisfaction)
- Establish anonymity policies for each survey type
- Set baseline participation targets (minimum response rates)

#### 2. Understand the Engagement Question Bank

Engagement surveys come with a pre-built question bank organized into 10 categories. You can customize questions during the survey creation wizard.

<div class="nav-path">

Insights → Engagement insights → New engagement survey → Step 1: Questions

</div>

The 10 pre-built engagement categories are:

- **eNPS** — 1 question (Net Promoter Score: "How likely are you to recommend our company as a place to work?" on a 0-10 scale)
- **Work environment** — 2 questions
- **Recognition & Reward** — 2 questions
- **Growth** — 2 questions
- **Manager Support** — 2 questions
- **Employee Wellbeing** — 2 questions
- **Performance Management** — 2 questions
- **Meaningful Work** — 2 questions
- **Organization Fit** — 2 questions
- **Teamwork** — 2 questions

Within each category you can remove existing questions or click **"Add another question"** to create custom ones.

#### Available Templates

Bayzat provides 7 pre-built survey templates. Navigate to **Insights → Surveys → New survey → Choose a template** to preview any template before using it.

<div class="nav-path">

Insights → Surveys → New survey → Choose a template

</div>

| Template | Questions | Time | Purpose |
|----|----|----|----|
| **Employee Engagement** | 19 | 10 mins | Measure performance against 9 key engagement drivers. Results feed into Engagement insights. |
| **Weekly Pulse Survey** | 2 | 2 mins | Track employee morale on a weekly basis with emoji mood scale and open comments. |
| **Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS)** | 2 | 2 mins | Measure how employees feel about the company using the standard NPS 0-10 scale. |
| **Bayz Wellness Feedback** | 7 | 5 mins | Collect feedback on wellness events (biometric screenings, yoga, nutrition talks, etc.). |
| **Employee Satisfaction Survey** | 12 | 7 mins | Measure job satisfaction across work, growth, compensation, and manager relationships. |
| **Work Environment Survey** | 11 | 7 mins | Assess physical workspace, tools, teamwork, training, and job security. |
| **Health Insurance Feedback** | 8 | 8 mins | Understand employee priorities and experience with health insurance coverage. |

Each template preview has two tabs:

- **Questions tab:** Browse all questions and their types before starting

<figcaption>Employee Engagement template preview showing Questions and Sample Results tabs</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Question Scales

- **eNPS:** 0–10 scale (Not at all likely → Extremely likely)
- **Engagement categories:** 1–10 scale (Strongly Disagree → Strongly Agree)
- **Satisfaction/Mood:** 5-point emoji scale (Extremely dissatisfied → Extremely satisfied, or Terrible → Amazing)
- **Rating:** 1–5 numeric scale (Not at all → Significantly, or Terrible → Excellent)

Click **"Start from this template"** to enter the 4-step creation wizard (Questions → Participants → Settings → Review).

<div class="info-box">

**Note:** There is no standalone settings page for engagement questions. The question bank is configured directly inside the engagement survey creation wizard (Step 1: Questions).

</div>

#### 3. Set Up 360 Review Feedback Categories

If using 360-degree reviews, configure feedback categories before creating surveys.

<div class="nav-path">

Settings → Performance

</div>

- Define categories relevant to performance evaluation (e.g., Leadership, Communication, Technical Skills, Collaboration)
- Align categories with organizational competency frameworks
- Enable AI survey generation to use these categories for targeted question creation

#### 4. Configure Participant Groups

- Verify employee registration status (unregistered employees will be highlighted during survey creation)
- Review department and job role data accuracy for demographic filtering
- Establish manager hierarchies for upward feedback in 360 reviews
- Identify peer groups for peer feedback collection

#### 5. Establish Survey Naming Conventions

- Create consistent naming format: \[Type\] - \[Date/Period\] - \[Target Group\]
- Example: "Engagement Q1 2024 - All Employees" or "Exit Survey - January 2024"
- Use categorization for high-volume survey management (folders or tags)

#### 6. Plan Notification & Reminder Settings

Notifications are configured per survey during the creation wizard (Step 3: Settings → Notifications and reminders).

<div class="nav-path">

Survey creation wizard → Step 3: Settings → Notifications and reminders

</div>

- **Publication notification:** Notify all participants when survey is published (Email + App notification, enabled by default)
- **Reminders for non-responders:**
  - 7 days before survey ends (Email + App)
  - 5 days before survey ends (Email + App)
  - 3 days before survey ends (Email + App, enabled by default)
  - 1 day before survey ends (Email + App, enabled by default)

#### 7. Understand Survey Settings (Step 3 of Creation Wizard)

Every survey has four configuration panels in Step 3: Settings. Decide on these before publishing.

<div class="nav-path">

</tbody>
</table>

<div class="warning-box">

**⚠️ Anonymity Threshold:** Anonymous surveys require a minimum of 3 respondents per group. If a department, manager group, or filter selection contains fewer than 3 respondents, their results are hidden to prevent identifying individuals. For non-engagement surveys, the system prevents creating an anonymous survey with fewer than 3 total participants.

</div>

</div>

<div class="subsection">

#### Result Visualization Types

When you view results (either in Sample Results previews or actual survey results), questions produce one of five visualization types:

| Visualization | Question Type | What It Shows | Used In |
|----|----|----|----|
| **NPS Donut Chart** | eNPS / NPS (0-10 recommend scale) | Donut chart split into Promoters (9-10, green), Passives (7-8, yellow), and Detractors (0-6, pink). NPS Score displayed in center. | Employee Engagement, eNPS |
| **Numeric Scale Bar Chart** | Opinion scale (0-10, 1-10, or 1-5) | Vertical bars for each scale value showing percentage and respondent count. Average response score displayed above. | All templates with scale questions |
| **Emoji Scale Bar Chart** | Satisfaction / Mood (5-point emoji) | Five vertical bars with emoji faces ranging from negative to positive. Percentage, respondent count, and average shown. | Weekly Pulse, Employee Satisfaction, Work Environment |
| **Multiple Choice Horizontal Bars** | Single-select / Multi-select | Horizontal bars per option showing response count and percentage. Labeled "(multiple choice selection)". | Employee Satisfaction, Work Environment, Bayz Wellness |
| **Free Text Response List** | Open-ended text | Scrollable list of individual responses with "All responses" and "Starred" tabs. Star notable responses for follow-up. | All templates with text questions |

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mashapajfhp/user-guides/main/surveys/v1/validation/screenshots/51-enps-sample-results.png" class="screenshot" loading="lazy" alt="eNPS Sample Results showing NPS donut chart and bar chart" />
<figcaption>eNPS template Sample Results: NPS donut chart (top), per-value bar chart (middle), and free text responses (bottom)</figcaption>
</figure>

The NPS donut chart shows three segments:

- **Promoters (9-10):** Highly satisfied employees likely to recommend the company
- **Passives (7-8):** Satisfied but not enthusiastic — at risk of disengaging
- **Detractors (0-6):** Dissatisfied employees who may negatively impact morale

**NPS Score = % Promoters - % Detractors.** Example: 40% Promoters - 20% Detractors = NPS Score of 20. Scores range from -100 to +100. A score above 0 is good; above 30 is excellent.

Below the donut chart, a bar chart shows the per-value distribution (0 through 10) with the number of respondents and percentage for each value.

#### How to Read Scale Results

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mashapajfhp/user-guides/main/surveys/v1/validation/screenshots/52-satisfaction-sample-results.png" class="screenshot" loading="lazy" alt="Employee Satisfaction Sample Results showing emoji scale and multiple choice visualizations" />
<figcaption>Employee Satisfaction template Sample Results: emoji scale charts (top), multiple choice bars (middle), free text list (bottom)</figcaption>
</figure>

Each scale question displays:

- **Response count:** "X out of Y respondents answered this question" — shows participation rate per question
- **Average response:** Displayed with a green indicator (e.g., "Avg response: 4.0") — higher is better
- **Distribution bars:** Vertical bars showing how responses are spread across the scale values
- **Scale labels:** Anchor text at the bottom (e.g., "Extremely dissatisfied" to "Extremely satisfied")

#### How to Read Multiple Choice Results

Multiple choice questions display horizontal bars showing:

- Each answer option with its response count and percentage (e.g., "4 responses \| 40%")
- Bar width proportional to the percentage of respondents who selected that option
- Only options that received responses are displayed with visible bars

#### How to Read Free Text Results

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mashapajfhp/user-guides/main/surveys/v1/validation/screenshots/50-weekly-pulse-sample-results.png" class="screenshot" loading="lazy" alt="Weekly Pulse Sample Results showing emoji scale and free text responses" />
<figcaption>Weekly Pulse template Sample Results: emoji mood scale (top) and free text responses with starring capability (bottom)</figcaption>
</figure>

Free text responses appear as a scrollable list with two tabs:

- **All responses:** Complete list of written feedback from respondents
- **Starred:** Responses you have bookmarked for follow-up or discussion

Each response has two action buttons:

- **Expand (arrow icon):** View the full response text in a larger view
- **Star (star icon):** Bookmark notable responses for follow-up — starred responses appear in the "Starred" tab

<div class="info-box">

**Tip:** Use the Sample Results tab when previewing templates to understand what your results dashboard will look like before launching a survey. This helps you choose the right question types to get the visualizations you need for analysis.

<div class="section-body">

<div class="subsection">

### Automation Capabilities

<div class="nav-path">

Automations → Workflows → + Create workflow

</div>

<div class="info-box">

**Not Available:** Surveys does not currently support workflow automation triggers or actions.

</div>

Survey distribution and reminders are managed through the survey configuration interface, not through the workflow automation system.

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Alternative Automation

While surveys cannot be triggered by workflows, the following automation features are available within the survey module:

- **Scheduled Distribution** — Set survey start and end dates during creation
- **Automated Reminders** — Configure reminder frequency for non-respondents
- **Email Notifications** — Automatic notifications sent to participants when surveys launch
- **Health Insurance Surveys** — Automated survey generation for GH insurance clients (planned enhancement)

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Integration Points

Surveys integrate with other platform features through data connections:

- **Employee Records** — Demographic data (department, gender) used for filtering and analysis
- **Notification System** — Push and email notifications for survey distribution
- **Mobile App** — Survey completion interface accessible on mobile devices
- **Reporting/Analytics** — Survey results feed into engagement trends and heatmaps
- **Performance Management** — Engagement data may inform performance decisions

## Business Rules & Limitations

</div>

<div class="section-body">

<div class="subsection">

### Survey Creation & Management

| Rule | Description | Impact |
|----|----|----|
| **Anonymous Response Threshold** | Anonymous responses are hidden for groups with fewer than 3 employees | Protects individual identity but may limit detailed analysis for small teams |
| **Survey Editing Restrictions** | Cannot edit surveys once they are in 'ongoing' state | Questions can only be modified during draft or scheduled states |
| **Engagement Driver Requirements** | At least 1 scale question required for each engagement driver | Survey cannot be saved without meeting this minimum |
| **Question Limits** | Maximum of 30 questions per 360 review survey | Prevents survey fatigue while limiting comprehensive assessments |
| **Participant Group Limits** | Up to 4 participant groups per 360 review | Includes self, managers, peers, and optional direct reports |

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Survey Distribution & Responses

- **Unregistered Employees:** Employees not registered on Bayzat will be highlighted during participant selection but cannot receive surveys
- **Response Timing:** Surveys can only be responded to after the configured start date/time
- **Survey Duration:** Minimum survey response time is 10 days; recommended duration is 30 days
- **Historical Data:** Employee data used in analysis reflects values at time of survey submission, not current values

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Reporting & Analysis Constraints

<div class="warning-box">

**⚠️ Export Limitations**

Survey reports can only export completed submissions. The platform UI can filter non-submitters, but export functionality does not support this view.

</div>

| Limitation | Description | Status |
|----|----|----|
| NPS Score Export | NPS scores display on platform UI but are not included in downloadable report exports | Known Gap |
| Small Group Anonymity | Heatmap results are blurred for departments with fewer than 3 respondents | By Design |
| Demographic Filter Risks | Small response sample sizes may reveal anonymous identities through demographic filters | User Caution Required |

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Survey Deletion & Modification

<div class="warning-box">

**⚠️ No Self-Service Deletion**

The platform lacks a self-service mechanism for comprehensive survey deletion. Users cannot independently remove surveys and must contact engineering for data cleanup tasks.

</div>

<div class="info-box">

**Post-Launch Changes:** Cannot add questions to ongoing surveys or reopen completed surveys without backend intervention.

</div>

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Automation & Integration

- **Health Insurance Surveys:** Automated surveys are only triggered for GH insurance clients
- **Survey Frequency Risk:** Automation may increase survey frequency, leading to survey fatigue
- **Custom Questions:** Custom engagement questions may not be comparable across time periods
- **Platform Adoption:** Current usage is approximately 19% in UAE and 25% in KSA of eligible companies

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Known System Issues

| Issue | Impact | Severity |
|----|----|----|
| Cannot add participants dynamically | Restricts efficient management of exit and probation review processes | Medium |
| Limited Hotjar user attribute mapping | Cannot provide comprehensive user metadata within survey tracking | Low |

## Troubleshooting & Edge Cases

</div>

<div class="section-body">

<div class="subsection">

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|----|----|----|
| Survey results not visible | Fewer than 1 employee has responded | Wait for at least one response before viewing results |
| Anonymous responses hidden | Filter criteria results in fewer than 3 employees | Broaden filter criteria or review at higher organizational level |
| Cannot edit survey questions | Survey is in 'ongoing' state | Questions can only be edited during draft or scheduled states; contact support for urgent changes |
| Engagement driver error | No scale question assigned to engagement driver | Add at least one scale question to each engagement driver before saving |
| Unregistered employees highlighted | Selected participants are not registered on Bayzat | Register employees on platform before sending survey or remove from participant list |
| Export missing NPS scores | NPS scores only display in UI, not in exports | Manually record NPS scores from platform UI for external reporting |
| Cannot delete completed survey | No self-service deletion mechanism | Contact engineering team for survey deletion requests |
| AI-generated questions not relevant | Prompt lacks specificity or context | Regenerate with more detailed prompt including survey topic, purpose, and industry context |

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Edge Cases

- **Survey Fatigue:** Employees may disengage if surveys are too frequent or if feedback appears ignored; balance frequency with action on results
- **Cross-Platform Responses:** Employees can save draft responses on web and resume on mobile, or vice versa
- **Historical Data Gaps:** When calculating time trends, gaps in historical data may affect accuracy of trend analysis
- **Anonymous Feedback Paradox:** Improved anonymity may reduce admin ability to act on specific feedback while encouraging honest responses
- **Small Team Analysis:** Demographic filters on anonymous surveys may inadvertently reveal identities in teams with fewer than 5 members
- **Automated Survey Timing:** Health insurance surveys triggered automatically may conflict with other scheduled surveys, increasing response burden
- **Custom Question Comparability:** Custom engagement questions cannot be compared to historical data if they differ from standard questions
- **Scheduled Survey Cancellation:** Scheduled surveys can be canceled from web or mobile before launch, but not after start time
- **Shared Results Visibility:** Shared survey results only show summary page, not detailed individual responses
- **Response Deadline Enforcement:** Surveys have defined deadlines, but system behavior when deadline passes varies by survey type

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Best Practices

- Test survey questions with small group before wide distribution
- Set realistic survey duration (minimum 10 days, recommended 30 days)
- Communicate survey purpose and anonymity status clearly to employees
- Review and act on feedback within 2-4 weeks of survey close
- Avoid scheduling multiple surveys simultaneously to prevent fatigue
- Use AI-generated questions as starting point, then customize for context
- Export and archive survey data before requesting deletion
- Monitor response rates and send targeted reminders to non-responders

## FAQs & Support

</div>

<div class="section-body">

<div class="subsection">

### Frequently Asked Questions

<div class="faq-accordion">

Can I edit a survey after employees have started responding?

No. Once a survey is ongoing and responses have been collected, you cannot edit questions or add new ones. You can only edit surveys in draft or scheduled states.

How do I delete a survey I no longer need?

The platform currently lacks self-service survey deletion. Contact the engineering team for assistance with removing surveys and associated data.

Can I export a report showing employees who haven't submitted the survey?

While you can filter non-submitters in the UI, the export functionality only supports completed submissions. You cannot generate downloadable reports for non-submitted surveys.

How do I add new participants to an existing survey?

You cannot dynamically add participants to ongoing surveys. Plan your participant list carefully before launching.

Can I reopen a completed survey?

No. The surveys module does not support reopening completed surveys. Create a new survey if you need to collect additional responses.

Why can't I see NPS scores in my downloaded report?

NPS scores are visible on the platform UI but are not included in exported reports. View scores directly in the platform.

How does anonymity work in surveys?

Anonymous responses are hidden for groups with fewer than 3 employees to protect individual identity. Results are blurred for small departments in heatmap views.

Can I use AI to create survey questions?

Yes. Use the 'Start from AI' option and provide a specific prompt describing your survey topic, purpose, and desired question types.

How do I track survey completion rates?

View response rates in the Results tab. The system shows overall completion percentages and allows filtering by department or role.

Can employees save incomplete survey responses?

Yes. Employees can save draft responses and resume surveys later on web or mobile platforms.
