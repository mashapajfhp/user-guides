    "description": "Operationally, \"daily wage calculator\" computes daily-rate based salary amounts based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Evidence connects this to unpaid leave deductions. Calculations may use either calendar or working days depending on configuration. Global payroll settings can override policy-level settings. UI/display mismatches reported in tickets. Recalculation gaps where changes do not retroactively update results. Customers request greater configurability and transparency."
