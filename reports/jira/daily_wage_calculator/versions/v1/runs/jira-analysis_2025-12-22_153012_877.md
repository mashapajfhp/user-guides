# daily_wage_calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-22  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily_wage_calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Lack of Automated Salary Calculation**: The current system cannot automatically calculate salary based on actual working days, requiring manual interventions and separate tracking. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Formula**: The daily wage calculator in payroll settings intentionally overrides the formula configured in the leave policy for unpaid leave. The leave policy formula appears greyed out, indicating it is not active. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied for daily wage calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were incorrectly based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in payroll deduction amount discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Leap Year Miscalculation**: The End of Service (EOS) gratuity calculator incorrectly handles leap years by defaulting to 365 days instead of 366 days for 2024, resulting in an inaccurate total service period and gratuity amount calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **End of Service Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Error**: Daily wage calculation for pro-rated amounts produces consistently lower amounts by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. The formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but results in slight undercalculation across all employees' End of Service settlements. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **EOS Gratuity Calculation Variance**: System gratuity calculation (AED 231,821) slightly differs from manual calculation (AED 252,485), with detailed breakdown showing system uses a tiered calculation method (21 days per year for first 5 years, 30 days per year after, prorated for partial years) _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Leap Year Handling**: The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently handle leap year days (specifically February 29th), causing minor discrepancies in service duration calculation. The system calculated 912 days, while manual calculation suggested 913 days by including the leap day. _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Incorrect Days Worked in Gratuity Calculation**: System calculates days worked with a potential extra day (622 vs 623 days), which impacts gratuity calculation precision. The platform adds one extra day in length of service duration calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Discrepancy in Leave Salary Calculation Days**: System calculates leave salary using a fixed divisor in policy configuration, which may not align with user expectations about calendar days. User expected daily wage to be divided by 31 days, but system was dividing by 30 days, resulting in a slight salary calculation difference (2940 SAR vs expected 2988 SAR). _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Leave Salary Accrual Calculation Varies by Monthly Working Days**: The daily wage calculator configured with 'working days' setting causes leave salary accrual amounts to fluctuate month-to-month due to varying working day counts. This leads to inconsistent cumulative totals across different months. _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Leave Salary Proration Calculation Mismatch**: The system uses separate configurations for leave salary and salary proration daily wage calculations, causing different results. Leave salary uses a 30-day divisor while salary proration uses 30.42 days, leading to calculation discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Salary Proration Calculation Confusion**: User initially misunderstood how working days are calculated based on work week configuration. The system was actually calculating correctly, but the user did not initially understand that their specific work week (NVK Operations) had all 7 days configured as working days. _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The daily wage calculator fails to correctly prorate salary when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing date. The system correctly prorates when departure date is in the past, but not when it's in the future. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Duplicate Payroll Deductions After Leave Recalculation**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Moving the leave request back to pending/accepted does not resolve the issue. Even after deleting the unpaid leave request entirely, the unpaid leave deduction persists in payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Inconsistency**: When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, the daily wage calculation becomes out of sync between Payroll and Time Off modules. This causes incorrect deduction amounts that cannot be retroactively corrected. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Using Non-Standard Divisor**: The system calculates unpaid leave deductions using a custom daily wage divisor (30.42 days) instead of calendar days, which can produce deduction amounts that differ from user expectations _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Incorrect Days Displayed in Unpaid Leave Remarks**: The system displays incorrect number of days in remarks for unpaid leave deduction in February, showing 31 days instead of 29 days (leap year), despite the underlying calculation being mathematically correct. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: Global daily rate configuration overrides policy-specific unpaid leave calculation methods, potentially leading to incorrect salary deductions. The system calculates unpaid leave deductions using a global daily rate that takes precedence over individual policy settings, which can result in deductions based on gross salary instead of basic salary. _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Unpaid Leave Daily Rate Incorrectly Displayed**: The system shows the daily rate from the payroll month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate does not reflect the month when leave occurred. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Limitations

- **Fixed 26 Working Days per Month Calculation**: Salary is currently based on a 26 working days per month standard: 365 (Days yearly) - 52 (Weekly off) = 313 / 12 = 26.08 working days _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **No Automatic Formula Synchronization**: There is no synchronized mechanism for daily wage formula configuration between leave policy and payroll modules. Manual alignment is required. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Salary Config Change Impact on Leave Deductions**: Unpaid leave deductions are calculated based on salary configuration existing at the time of leave request creation. Changes to salary configuration after leave request may not automatically update pending deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Incorrect Leap Year Day Handling**: The system defaults to 365 days per year, failing to recognize 366 days in leap years like 2024 _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Decimal Precision in Daily Wage Calculations**: Pro-rated amount calculations consistently produce amounts less than expected by small decimal points (0.1 or 0.2). _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Monthly Leave Accrual Constraint**: Leave days are accrued at end of month, not prorated for mid-month departures _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Service Duration Day Counting Rules**: Unclear rules for counting service days, including whether departure date is considered a working day and how leap year days are handled _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Hardcoded Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated using a fixed divisor of 30 days (Basic/30), which cannot be modified or configured to alternative formulas _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Rigid Leave Salary Calculation Logic**: Daily wage calculation follows a fixed policy setting that cannot be easily overridden for specific scenarios or month lengths. _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Leave Encashment Calculation Based on Monthly Working Days**: Leave encashment daily wage is calculated using the number of working days in each month, which causes monthly variations _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Separate Calculation Methods for Leave and Proration**: The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using independent daily wage configurations with different divisors. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Working Days Calculation Based on Work Week**: Daily wage proration is calculated based on the employee's assigned work week configuration, which may include all 7 days as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Limited Proration Date Handling**: Salary proration only works correctly for departure dates in the past, not for future departure dates. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Inconsistent Deduction Management**: The system cannot reliably manage payroll deductions when leave transactions are modified, deleted, or have status changes. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Cannot Recalculate Salary Deductions Retroactively**: The system cannot automatically recalculate salary deductions when public holidays are added after initial payroll calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Fixed 30.42 Days Divisor for Wage Calculations**: System uses a fixed 30.42 days divisor for calculating daily wage, which differs from calendar days _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Leap Year Day Calculation for Unpaid Leave**: Daily wage calculations must use the actual number of calendar days in a month, particularly for February in leap years (29 days, not 31 days). _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Settings Override Policy Configurations**: The platform has a global configuration that supersedes individual policy-level settings for unpaid leave calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Daily Rate Calculation Method**: Daily rate is calculated as (Basic + Allowances) / Working Days, excluding public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Troubleshooting Notes

- Unable to automatically adjust salary based on working days — Cause: Current system lacks built-in automation for attendance-based salary calculation — Workaround: Use a mix of unpaid leaves and overtime tracking, managed separately for each employee _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- Inconsistent Daily Wage Formula Display — Cause: Payroll settings daily wage calculator overrides leave policy formula. Greyed-out formula in leave policy indicates active override from payroll configuration. — Workaround: Verify daily wage calculator configuration in payroll settings to confirm the actual formula being applied for unpaid leave calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount due to outdated salary configuration — Cause: Leave request created before new salary configuration, causing calculation based on old salary setup — Workaround: Delete the existing leave request and recreate it if the deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Gratuity amount differs from MOHRE-confirmed calculation — Cause: System uses 365 days instead of 366 days for 2024 leap year — Workaround: Manually adjust calculation to use 366 days for leap years _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- End of Service calculations show slightly lower amounts than expected — Cause: Decimal precision error in daily wage calculation formula (basic + allowances / 30) — Workaround: Ticket was escalated to development team and resolved _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Leave balance not automatically included for mid-month departure — Cause: Monthly accrual policy requires full month completion to grant leave days — Workaround: Manually adjust leave balance in EOS section or switch to conditional daily accrual policy _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Gratuity Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-1625, TSSD-2043)_
- Discrepancy between expected and calculated leave salary — Cause: System uses predefined policy configuration for daily rate divisor, which may not match user's manual calculation expectations — Workaround: Verify daily rate configuration in leave policy and understand the system's calculation logic before challenging the result _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- Unexpected differences in leave salary accrual totals across months — Cause: Daily wage calculator set to 'working days' method, causing monthly calculation variations — Workaround: Consider using 'custom days' setting for more consistent leave encashment calculations _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Mismatched leave salary and salary proration calculations — Cause: Different divisors used for daily wage calculations (30 days vs 30.42 days) — Workaround: Manually align leave salary and salary proration daily wage configurations to use consistent divisors _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- Perceived incorrect salary proration calculation — Cause: Verify work week configuration to understand how working days are calculated — Workaround: Check employee's assigned work week policy and confirm if all days are configured as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- Full monthly salary displayed for offboarded employees with future departure dates — Cause: Calculation logic does not handle departure dates in future relative to payroll processing date — Workaround: Manually calculate and adjust prorated salary based on actual days worked _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Duplicate or persistent payroll deductions after leave request modifications — Cause: Lack of automated synchronization between leave management and payroll deduction systems — Workaround: Manual intervention required to remove orphaned or duplicate deductions _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Inconsistent daily wage calculation for unpaid leave — Cause: Daily wage calculated as (basic salary + allowance) / working days, where working days exclude weekends and public holidays — Workaround: Manual deduction adjustment or waiting for future module enhancement _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Deduction amount differs from expected monthly salary — Cause: Daily wage calculated as monthly salary (4300) divided by 30.42, resulting in 141.35 per day, then multiplied by days in leave period — Workaround: Verify unpaid leave policy settings and understand the 30.42 days divisor used in calculations _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- Discrepancy between displayed daily rate and actual calculation — Cause: Remarks field shows incorrect number of days, but actual calculation uses correct calendar days — Workaround: Verify actual deduction amount by calculating daily rate using correct number of calendar days for the specific month _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- Unexpected salary deductions for unpaid leave — Cause: System uses a global daily rate configuration that may not align with specific policy settings — Workaround: Verify and potentially adjust global daily rate configuration to match intended calculation method _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- Daily rate changes based on payroll processing month instead of leave occurrence month — Cause: System recalculates daily rate dynamically during payroll processing instead of storing the original rate — Workaround: A fix was deployed to store the initially calculated daily rate and display that amount consistently _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_
