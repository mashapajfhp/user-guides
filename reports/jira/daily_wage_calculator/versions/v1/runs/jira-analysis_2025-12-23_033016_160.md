# daily wage calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-22  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily wage calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Daily Wage Formula**: The daily wage calculator in payroll settings intentionally overrides the formula configured in leave policy for unpaid leave. The leave policy formula appears greyed out, indicating it is not active. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied for daily wage calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were incorrectly based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in payroll calculation discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-1581, TSSD-4368)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Calculation Incorrect for Leap Years**: The system incorrectly calculates service days by using 365 days instead of 366 days for 2024, resulting in an inaccurate gratuity amount. When calculating End of Service (EOS) gratuity, the system fails to recognize 2024 as a leap year, causing a calculation discrepancy of approximately AED 17.26. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Incorrect Pro-Rated End of Service Amount Calculation**: End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Complexity**: The daily wage calculator's gratuity calculation involves complex logic for handling partial years of service, especially for periods above 5 years. The system uses different calculation approaches for complete and incomplete years, including specific handling for leap years by using 366 as a divisor when appropriate. _(evidence: TSSD-4742, TSSD-2252)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Not Considering Leap Year Day**: System may not consistently account for February 29th when calculating service duration for gratuity, potentially causing minor discrepancies in total days worked (912 vs 913 days) _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Inconsistent Days Worked Calculation in Gratuity**: Platform calculates days worked with a potential extra day (622 vs 623 days), causing slight variations in gratuity calculation. The system uses a fixed divisor of 30 days for daily wage, which may not align with all client calculation preferences. _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Discrepancy**: System calculates leave salary based on predefined policy configuration, which may not align with user expectations about calendar days. The daily wage is divided by a configured number of days (30 vs 31), potentially causing salary calculation differences. _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Leave Salary Accrual Calculation Inconsistency**: The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. The daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals. _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Inconsistency**: The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using different daily wage divisors (30 vs 30.42 days), causing calculation discrepancies. Leave salary uses a 30-day divisor while salary proration uses 30.42 days, leading to different prorated amounts. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Calculation Confusion**: User initially misunderstood how working days are calculated based on work week configuration. The system was calculating correctly, but the user did not initially understand that their specific work week (NVK Operations) had all 7 days configured as working days. _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The system fails to correctly prorate salaries when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing date. When an employee is offboarded (e.g., on Nov 28th) and payroll is processed earlier (e.g., Nov 27th), the system displays the full monthly salary instead of a prorated amount. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Duplicate Payroll Deductions After Leave Recalculation**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Moving the leave request back to pending/accepted does not resolve the issue. Even after deleting the unpaid leave request entirely, the unpaid leave deduction persists in payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Mismatch**: When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, the daily wage calculation becomes inconsistent between Payroll and Time Off modules. This causes incorrect salary deduction amounts that cannot be retroactively corrected. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Incorrect Days Displayed in Unpaid Leave Remarks**: The platform displays incorrect remarks for daily wage calculations in February, showing 31 days instead of the actual 29 days for leap years. The backend calculation remains accurate, but the frontend display creates potential user confusion. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Daily Rate Configuration Overrides Policy Settings**: The system applies a global daily rate configuration that overrides individual leave policy settings for unpaid leave calculations. This means the daily wage is calculated using a system-wide setting instead of policy-specific methods, potentially leading to incorrect salary deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Incorrect Daily Rate Month Display**: The system shows the daily rate from the payroll month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate does not match the month when leave occurred. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Limitations

- **Lack of Automated Salary Proration**: The current Bayzat payroll system lacks automated salary calculation based on precise working days. The platform cannot dynamically adjust salaries proportionally when employees work more or fewer than the standard 26 working days. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Take Precedence Over Leave Policy**: Payroll daily wage calculator configuration overrides leave policy formula for unpaid leave calculations. The leave policy formula becomes inactive and is displayed as greyed out. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Salary Config Change Impact on Leave Deductions**: Unpaid leave deductions may not automatically update if salary configuration changes after leave request creation _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Incorrect Handling of Leap Year Days in Service Period**: The system defaults to 365 days per year, failing to correctly account for leap years when calculating total service days for gratuity computation. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Decimal Precision Limitation in Pro-Rated Calculations**: Pro-rated amounts are calculated using (basic + allowances / 30), but suffer from decimal precision errors that consistently underreport amounts. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Mid-Month Departure Leave Accrual Limitation**: Leave days are accrued at end of month, preventing inclusion of partial month leave in End of Service (EOS) calculations _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Service Duration Calculation Ambiguity**: Unclear methodology for counting service days, including departure date and leap year days _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Complex Service Duration Calculation**: The system calculates service duration with nuanced rules, including different approaches for years before and after 5 years of service, and specific handling of partial years. _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- **Fixed Daily Wage Divisor Limitation**: Daily wage is calculated using a hardcoded divisor of 30 days (Basic/30), which cannot be modified or configured to alternative formulas like (Basic × 12/365) _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Inflexible Daily Wage Calculation**: The platform cannot override the standard leave salary calculation method based on policy configurations. Users are bound by the predefined divisor settings for daily wage calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Leave Encashment Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Leave salary accrual is calculated based on working days, which varies month to month _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Separate Daily Wage Calculation Methods**: The platform calculates leave salary and salary proration using separate configurations that cannot be automatically aligned without manual intervention. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Based on Work Week Configuration**: Salary proration is calculated based on the specific work week configuration, which may include all 7 days as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Inconsistent Salary Proration Based on Departure Date**: Salary proration only works correctly when departure date is in the past, not when it's in the future _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Unreliable Leave Transaction Deduction Management**: Leave management system does not reliably sync deduction changes with payroll module when leave transactions are modified, deleted, or status is changed. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated as: (basic salary + allowance) / working days, where working days exclude weekends and public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Lack of Real-Time Module Communication**: Time Off module cannot send complete leave request details to Payroll module in real-time, causing calculation inconsistencies _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Fixed 30.42 Days Divisor for Wage Calculations**: System uses a fixed 30.42 days divisor for daily wage calculations, which may not align with calendar months _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **February Days Calculation in Leap Years**: The system may default to 31 days when calculating daily rates for February, instead of using the correct 29 days in leap years. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Settings Override Policy-Level Calculations**: The platform has a global configuration that supersedes individual policy-level settings for unpaid leave calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Daily Rate Calculation Method**: Daily rate is calculated as (Basic + Allowances) / Working Days, excluding public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

- Leave request created in different month from payroll processing month — Potential misalignment of daily rate calculation and display _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Troubleshooting Notes

- Unable to automatically adjust salary based on actual working days — Cause: Current payroll system lacks automated proration capabilities — Workaround: Use a mix of unpaid leaves and overtime tracking, managed separately for each employee _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- Inconsistent daily wage formula display between leave policy and payroll settings — Cause: Payroll settings are designed to override leave policy formula for unpaid leave calculations — Workaround: Configure daily wage calculator in payroll settings first; verify the formula matches intended calculation method _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount — Cause: Deduction calculated based on outdated salary configuration — Workaround: Delete the existing leave request and recreate it if deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Discrepancy in End of Service Gratuity Calculation — Cause: System uses a fixed 365-day year calculation, failing to recognize leap years — Workaround: Manually adjust calculation to use 366 days for leap years when computing service period and gratuity _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- End of Service calculation shows amounts less than expected (e.g., 89,999.9 instead of 9000) — Cause: Decimal precision error in daily wage calculation formula (basic + allowances / 30) — Workaround: Development team has been escalated and the issue was reportedly resolved. Users should verify calculations after the fix. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Discrepancy between system and manual gratuity calculations — Cause: Calculation involves splitting service duration into different rate periods (21 days/year for first 5 years, 30 days/year after) — Workaround: Manually verify calculation by: 1) Calculate daily wage (total salary/30), 2) Apply tiered rates based on service duration, 3) Prorate partial years by days/365 _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Gratuity Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-1625, TSSD-2043)_
- Mismatch between manual and system gratuity calculations — Cause: Different methodologies for calculating service duration, especially for periods above 5 years and handling of partial years — Workaround: Understand system's specific calculation logic, including use of 366 days for leap years and pro-rata calculation for incomplete years _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- Unexpected leave salary calculation results — Cause: Salary calculated based on fixed policy configuration rather than actual calendar days — Workaround: Verify daily rate configuration in leave policy settings; understand that system follows policy rules for calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- Unexpected variations in leave salary accrual amounts across months — Cause: Daily wage calculator set to 'working days' method, causing calculation variations — Workaround: Consider using 'custom days' setting for more consistent leave encashment calculations _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Discrepancy in leave salary calculation — Cause: Different divisors used for leave salary (30 days) and salary proration (30.42 days) — Workaround: Manually align daily wage configurations or verify specific calculation method with payroll team _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- Apparent incorrect salary proration — Cause: Check work week configuration to understand how working days are defined — Workaround: Verify employee's work week setup to confirm expected proration calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- Full monthly salary displayed for offboarded employees — Cause: Calculation logic does not properly handle departure dates in future relative to payroll processing — Workaround: Manually calculate prorated salary based on daily rate (total monthly salary / 30 * days worked) _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Duplicate or persistent payroll deductions after leave transaction modifications — Cause: Lack of automated synchronization between leave management and payroll deduction systems — Workaround: Manual intervention required to remove orphaned or duplicate deductions. Recommend backend cleanup of inconsistent deduction entries. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Salary deduction does not match full month's expected amount — Cause: Misalignment between public holiday configuration and leave request timing — Workaround: Manually add deduction to correct the calculated amount, though not recommended by customers _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Unexpected deduction amount for extended unpaid leave — Cause: Daily wage calculated as 4300/30.42 = 141.35, then multiplied by days of leave (31 days = 4,381.99) — Workaround: Manually verify daily wage divisor and leave policy configuration _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- Discrepancy between displayed daily rate and actual calculation — Cause: Remarks field shows incorrect number of days (31 instead of 29) for February in leap years — Workaround: Verify actual deduction amount by calculating daily rate using correct calendar days (29 for February in leap years) _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- Discrepancy between expected and actual unpaid leave deduction calculations — Cause: Global daily rate configuration overrides policy-specific calculation methods — Workaround: Verify and adjust global daily rate configuration settings _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- Daily rate displayed does not match leave occurrence month — Cause: System recalculates daily rate based on payroll processing month instead of storing original calculation — Workaround: A fix was deployed to store the initially calculated daily rate and display that amount _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_
