# daily wage calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-22  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily wage calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Lack of Automated Daily Wage Calculation**: Current system lacks automated salary calculation based on actual working days, requiring manual interventions and separate tracking of overtime and unpaid leaves. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Daily Wage Formula**: The daily wage calculator in payroll settings intentionally overrides the leave policy formula for unpaid leave. The leave policy formula appears greyed out, indicating it is not the active calculation method. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were calculated based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in incorrect payroll deduction amounts. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Calculation Incorrect for Leap Years**: The system incorrectly calculates service days by using 365 days instead of 366 days for leap years (specifically 2024), resulting in an inaccurate total service period and lower gratuity amount. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Incorrect Pro-Rated End of Service Amount Calculation**: End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Complexity**: The system's gratuity calculation involves complex logic for handling partial years of service, especially for periods above 5 years. The calculation differs from manual expectations by using specific day-counting methods that account for leap years and incomplete service periods. _(evidence: TSSD-4742, TSSD-2252)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy with Leap Year Days**: The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently handle leap year days (February 29th), causing minor discrepancies in total service days and resulting gratuity amount. The system calculated 912 days, while manual calculation included 913 days by explicitly counting the leap day. _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Days Worked Calculation Discrepancy**: System calculates 623 days instead of 622 days when computing employee service tenure, potentially causing slight variations in gratuity calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Discrepancy**: System calculates leave salary based on predefined policy configuration, which may not align with user expectations about calendar days and prorated calculations. The daily wage is divided according to policy settings (potentially 30 vs 31 days), causing potential salary amount mismatches. _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Leave Salary Accrual Calculation Inconsistency**: The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. The daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals. _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Leave Salary Proration Calculation Discrepancy**: The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using independent daily wage configurations with different divisors (30 vs 30.42 days), causing calculation mismatches. The client expects a consistent daily wage formula of (Basic salary + allowances / 30.42 days), but the system uses separate configurations. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Calculation Confusion**: User misunderstood how working days are calculated based on work week configuration. The system was actually calculating correctly, but the user did not initially understand that their specific work week (NVK Operations) had all 7 days configured as working days. _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The system fails to correctly prorate salary when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing date. When an employee is offboarded (e.g., on Nov 28th) and payroll is processed earlier (e.g., on Nov 27th), the system displays the full monthly salary instead of prorating based on actual working days. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Duplicate Payroll Deductions During Leave Recalculation**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Moving the leave request back to pending/accepted does not resolve the issue. Even after deleting the unpaid leave request entirely, the unpaid leave deduction persists in payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, the daily wage calculation becomes inconsistent between Payroll and Time Off modules. This causes incorrect salary deduction amounts that cannot be retroactively corrected. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Deduction Calculation Using Non-Standard Divisor**: The system calculates unpaid leave deductions using a custom daily wage divisor (30.42 days) instead of calendar days, which can produce deduction amounts that differ from user expectations _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Incorrect Days Displayed in Unpaid Leave Remarks**: The platform displays incorrect remarks for daily wage calculations in February, showing 31 days instead of the actual 29 days for leap years. The backend calculation remains accurate, but the frontend display creates potential user confusion. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Daily Rate Configuration Overrides Policy Settings**: The system applies a global daily rate configuration that supersedes individual leave policy calculations for unpaid leave. This results in deductions being calculated using a system-wide setting instead of policy-specific methods, potentially leading to incorrect salary deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Incorrect Daily Rate Month Display**: The system shows the daily rate from the payroll processing month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate does not match the month of leave. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Limitations

- **Fixed 26 Working Days Monthly Calculation**: Salary is based on a standard 26 working days per month, calculated from 365 annual days minus 52 weekly offs, resulting in 313 working days per year divided by 12 months. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Take Precedence Over Leave Policy**: Payroll daily wage calculator configuration overrides leave policy formula for unpaid leave calculations. The leave policy formula is greyed out and cannot be directly edited. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Salary Config Creation Impacts Deduction Calculation**: Unpaid leave deductions depend on the timing of salary configuration creation relative to leave request submission. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Incorrect Handling of Leap Year Days in Service Calculation**: The system defaults to 365 days per year, failing to recognize leap years with 366 days in gratuity calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Decimal Precision in Pro-Rated Calculations**: Pro-rated amounts are calculated using basic + allowances / 30, but with inconsistent decimal handling that results in slightly lower amounts. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Monthly Accrual Limits Mid-Month Departures**: Platform lacks flexible leave accrual handling for mid-month departures, defaulting to monthly accrual that does not prorate or include partial month leave balances _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Ambiguity in Service Days Counting Methodology**: Unclear rules for counting service days, including whether departure date is considered a working day and how leap year days are integrated _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Leap Year Day Counting Methodology**: The system uses 366 as a divisor for years containing leap years when calculating partial service periods, which can lead to slight differences in gratuity calculations compared to manual methods. _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- **Fixed Daily Wage Divisor**: Daily wage is always calculated using a fixed divisor of 30 days (Basic Salary / 30), which cannot be modified or configured to alternative formulas _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Daily Wage Divisor Configuration**: The platform uses a fixed divisor for daily wage calculation based on policy configuration, which cannot be easily overridden for specific scenarios. _(evidence: TSSD-4731, TSSD-4368)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Method Constraints**: Leave encashment daily wage can be calculated using 'working days' or 'custom days' settings, which directly impacts monthly accrual calculations _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Separate Daily Wage Calculation Methods**: The Bayzat platform calculates leave salary and salary proration using independent daily wage configurations that cannot be automatically aligned without manual configuration. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Daily Wage Proration Depends on Work Week Setup**: Salary proration is calculated based on the specific work week configuration, which can include all days as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Inconsistent Salary Proration Based on Departure Date**: Salary proration only works correctly when departure date is in the past; fails for future departure dates _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Inconsistent Deduction Handling in Leave Transactions**: The system does not automatically remove or reconcile payroll deductions when leave requests are modified, deleted, or have their status changed. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated as: (basic salary + allowance) / working days, where working days exclude weekends and public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Lack of Real-Time Module Communication**: Time Off module does not send complete leave request details to Payroll module at the time of calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **February Days Calculation Limitation**: The system may default to 31 days when calculating daily rates for February, potentially causing display discrepancies in leap years. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Settings Override Policy-Level Configurations**: The platform has a global configuration that supersedes individual policy-level settings for unpaid leave calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Daily Rate Calculation Method**: Daily rate calculated as (Basic + Allowances) / Working Days, excluding public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Troubleshooting Notes

- Unable to automatically adjust salary based on working days — Cause: Current payroll system lacks automated proration capabilities — Workaround: Manually track unpaid leaves and overtime separately for each employee _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- Inconsistent daily wage formula display between leave policy and payroll settings — Cause: Payroll settings intentionally override leave policy formula for unpaid leave calculations — Workaround: Always verify daily wage calculator configuration in payroll settings first; ignore greyed-out formula in leave policy _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount — Cause: Deduction calculated based on outdated salary configuration — Workaround: Delete the leave request and recreate it if the deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Discrepancy in gratuity calculation between system and MOHRE reference — Cause: System incorrectly counts 365 days instead of 366 days for leap year — Workaround: Manually adjust calculation to use 366 days for leap years _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- Pro-rated amounts consistently lower by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals — Cause: Decimal precision error in daily wage calculation formula — Workaround: Ticket was escalated to development team and resolved _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Discrepancy between system and manual gratuity calculations — Cause: Complex calculation involving service duration splitting and different rates for service periods — Workaround: Manually verify calculation by splitting service duration and applying tiered rates (21 days for first 5 years, 30 days for subsequent years) _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Gratuity Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-1625, TSSD-2043)_
- Differences between manual and system gratuity calculations — Cause: Variation stems from system's specific methodology for counting days in partial years, especially those including leap years — Workaround: Verify calculation by breaking down service period into segments: first 5 years at 21 days per year, subsequent years at 30 days per year, with precise day counting for partial years _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- Discrepancy between expected and calculated leave salary amount — Cause: System calculates leave salary based on predefined policy configuration, with a fixed daily rate divisor that may not match user expectations — Workaround: Verify daily rate configuration in leave policy and understand how the system calculates prorated salary _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- Unexpected differences in leave salary accrual totals across months — Cause: Daily wage calculator set to 'working days' method, causing monthly calculation variations — Workaround: Switch to 'custom days' setting in leave encashment configuration for more consistent calculations _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Discrepancy in leave salary calculation — Cause: Different divisors used for leave salary (30 days) and salary proration (30.42 days) — Workaround: Manually align daily wage configurations or use consistent divisor across calculations _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- Salary proration appears incorrect — Cause: Check work week configuration to understand how working days are defined — Workaround: Verify employee's work week setup to confirm working days calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- Salary not prorated correctly for offboarded employees — Cause: Calculation logic fails to handle departure dates relative to payroll processing date — Workaround: Manually calculate prorated salary using daily rate: (Monthly Salary / 30) * Days Worked _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Duplicate payroll deductions persist after modifying or deleting leave transactions — Cause: Synchronization failure between leave management and payroll deduction systems — Workaround: Manual intervention required to remove orphaned or duplicate deductions. Recommend contacting system administrator for backend cleanup. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Incorrect salary deduction due to public holiday timing — Cause: Mismatch between Payroll and Time Off module calculations — Workaround: Manually add deduction to correct the salary calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4368, TSSD-1807)_
- Discrepancy between displayed daily rate and actual calculation — Cause: System uses different day counts for calculation and display in February — Workaround: Verify actual deduction amount against displayed daily rate, focusing on the backend calculation which remains accurate _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- Incorrect salary deduction for unpaid leave — Cause: Global daily rate configuration overriding policy-specific calculation methods — Workaround: Verify global unpaid leave daily rate configuration and understand its precedence over policy-level settings _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
