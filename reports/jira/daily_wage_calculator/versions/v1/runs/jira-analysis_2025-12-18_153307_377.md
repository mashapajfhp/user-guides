# daily wage calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-18  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily wage calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Lack of Automated Salary Calculation**: Current system cannot automatically calculate salary based on actual working days, requiring manual interventions and separate tracking of overtime and unpaid leaves. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Daily Wage Formula**: The daily wage calculator in payroll settings intentionally overrides the leave policy formula for unpaid leave. The leave policy formula appears greyed out, indicating it is not active. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied for daily wage calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were incorrectly based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in payroll calculation discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Calculation Incorrect for Leap Years**: The system incorrectly calculates service days by using 365 days instead of 366 days for 2024, resulting in an inaccurate gratuity amount. The correct calculation should include 366 days for leap years. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **End of Service Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Error**: End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **EOS Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy**: System gratuity calculation shows slight differences from manual calculations, with complexity arising from service duration split and tiered gratuity rates _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Leap Year Day Handling**: The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently handle leap year days (specifically February 29th), causing minor discrepancies in total service days and resulting gratuity amount calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Inconsistent Days Calculation in Gratuity**: Platform calculates days worked with a potential extra day (622 vs 623 days), causing minor variations in gratuity calculations. The system uses a fixed 30-day divisor for daily wage, which differs from client's preferred (Basic × 12 / 365) calculation method. _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Discrepancy**: System calculates leave salary based on predefined policy configuration, which may not align with user expectations about calendar days and prorated calculations. Users might misunderstand how daily wage is divided (31 vs 30 days) and challenge the resulting prorated salary amount. _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Leave Salary Accrual Calculation Inconsistency**: The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. The daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals. _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Leave Salary Proration Calculation Discrepancy**: The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using different daily wage configurations with independent divisors (30 vs 30.42 days), causing calculation mismatches. The client expects a consistent daily wage formula of (Basic salary + allowances / 30.42 days), but the system uses separate configurations. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Calculation Confusion**: User initially misunderstood how working days are calculated based on work week configuration. The system was actually calculating correctly, with working days determined by the specific work week policy (in this case, NVK Operations having all 7 days configured as working days). _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Inconsistent Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The daily wage calculator fails to consistently prorate salaries based on employee departure dates. When an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing, the system does not apply correct proration, displaying the full monthly salary instead. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Duplicate Payroll Deductions After Leave Request Modification**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Deleting the leave request does not remove associated payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Inconsistency**: When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, the daily wage calculation becomes out of sync between Payroll and Time Off modules. This results in incorrect deduction amounts that cannot be retroactively corrected. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Variance**: The system calculates unpaid leave deductions using a custom daily wage divisor (30.42 days) instead of calendar days, which can produce deduction amounts that differ from user expectations _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Incorrect Days Displayed in Unpaid Leave Remarks**: The system displays incorrect daily rate remarks for February, showing 31 days instead of 29 days (leap year). The underlying calculation remains mathematically correct, but the remarks field shows an inaccurate day count. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Daily Rate Configuration Overrides Policy Settings**: The system applies a global daily rate configuration that supersedes individual leave policy calculations for unpaid leave, potentially causing incorrect salary deductions by using gross salary instead of basic salary. _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Incorrect Daily Rate Month Display**: The system shows the daily rate from the payroll processing month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate does not match the month when leave occurred. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Limitations

- **Fixed 26 Working Days Monthly Standard**: Salary is based on a 26 working days per month standard (365 annual days - 52 weekly offs = 313 working days / 12 months = 26.08 days) _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Configuration**: Payroll settings for daily wage calculator automatically supersede leave policy formulas for unpaid leave calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Salary Config Change Impact on Leave Deductions**: Leave deduction calculations are dependent on salary configuration timing. If a new salary configuration is created after a leave request, the system may use outdated salary information for deduction calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Incorrect Handling of 366-Day Years**: The system defaults to 365 days per year, failing to recognize leap years with 366 days in service period calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Decimal Precision Limitation in Pro-Rated Calculations**: Pro-rated amount calculations consistently produce results that are 0.1 or 0.2 decimals less than expected, affecting all employees' end of service calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Monthly Leave Accrual Limitation**: Leave days are accrued at end of month, meaning mid-month departures do not automatically include current month's leave balance _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Ambiguous Service Day Calculation Rules**: Unclear rules for counting service days, specifically around departure date inclusion and leap year day handling. _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Hardcoded Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated using a fixed divisor of 30 days (Basic/30), which cannot be modified via configuration _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Inflexible Daily Wage Divisor**: The platform does not allow easy override of the standard daily wage calculation method. Daily rate is divided based on a fixed policy configuration that may not reflect actual calendar variations. _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Working Days vs Custom Days Configuration**: Leave encashment daily wage can be calculated using 'working days' or 'custom days' setting, which directly impacts monthly accrual calculations _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Separate Calculation Methods for Leave and Proration**: The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using different divisors and independent configurations. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Based on Work Week Settings**: Daily wage proration calculates based on days configured as working in the employee's assigned work week, which may include all 7 days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Incomplete Salary Proration Mechanism**: Salary proration only works correctly for departure dates in the past, failing to handle future departure dates accurately _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Inconsistent Deduction Handling in Leave Transactions**: The system cannot reliably manage payroll deductions when leave requests are modified, deleted, or have status changes. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Payroll and Time Off Module Synchronization Limitation**: Time Off module does not send complete leave request details to Payroll module at the time of calculation, causing data inconsistency when configuration changes occur. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Fixed 30.42 Days Divisor for Wage Calculation**: System uses a fixed 30.42 days divisor for calculating daily wage, which may not align with calendar month days _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Month-Specific Daily Rate Calculation**: Daily wage calculations are based on calendar days, with specific handling for months with varying day counts (e.g., February in leap years). _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Settings Override Policy-Level Calculations**: The platform has a global configuration that supersedes individual policy-level settings for unpaid leave calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Daily Rate Calculation Method**: Daily rate calculated as (Basic + Allowances) / Working Days, excluding public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Troubleshooting Notes

- Unable to automatically prorate salary — Cause: Current system lacks built-in automation for attendance-based salary calculation — Workaround: Use a mix of unpaid leaves and overtime tracking, managed separately for each employee _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- Inconsistent daily wage formula display between leave policy and payroll settings — Cause: Payroll settings intentionally override leave policy formula for unpaid leave calculations — Workaround: Verify daily wage calculator configuration in payroll settings to confirm actual calculation method _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount — Cause: Deduction calculated based on previous salary configuration instead of current salary setup — Workaround: Delete the existing leave request and recreate it if the deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Gratuity Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-4179, TSSD-1625, TSSD-2043)_
- End of service calculations show incorrect pro-rated amounts — Cause: Decimal precision error in daily wage calculation formula (basic + allowances / 30) — Workaround: Verify calculations manually and cross-check with expected amounts _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Incomplete leave balance for mid-month departure — Cause: Monthly accrual policy prevents automatic prorating of leave days — Workaround: Manually adjust leave balance in EOS section or switch to conditional accrual policy for daily leave earning _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Discrepancy between expected and calculated leave salary — Cause: System uses predefined policy configuration for daily rate divisor, which may not match user expectations — Workaround: Verify daily rate configuration in leave policy and understand how system calculates prorated salary based on policy settings _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- Unexpected differences in leave salary accrual totals — Cause: Daily wage calculator set to 'working days' method, causing monthly calculation variations — Workaround: Switch to 'custom days' setting for more consistent leave encashment calculations _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Discrepancy between expected and system-calculated leave salary — Cause: Different divisors used for leave salary (30 days) and salary proration (30.42 days) — Workaround: Manually align daily wage configurations or adjust calculation method to use consistent divisor _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- Perceived incorrect salary proration — Cause: Verify employee's work week configuration to understand how working days are calculated — Workaround: Check work week policy to confirm if all days are marked as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- Full monthly salary displayed for offboarded employees — Cause: Calculation logic does not account for departure date relative to payroll processing date — Workaround: Manually calculate prorated salary using daily rate: (Monthly Salary / 30) * Days Worked _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Duplicate or persistent payroll deductions after leave request changes — Cause: Lack of automated synchronization between leave management and payroll systems — Workaround: Manual intervention required to remove orphaned or duplicate deductions _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Mismatch between expected and calculated salary deduction — Cause: Discrepancy in working days calculation due to late public holiday addition — Workaround: Manual deduction adjustment or reopening previous payroll cycles (not recommended) _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4368, TSSD-1807)_
- Mismatch between displayed daily rate and actual calculation — Cause: Calculation uses correct 29 days for February, but remarks incorrectly reference 31 days — Workaround: Verify actual deduction amount against backend calculation, not remarks display _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- Unexpected salary deductions during unpaid leave — Cause: Global daily rate configuration overriding policy-specific calculation methods — Workaround: Verify global unpaid leave daily rate settings and understand their precedence over policy-level configurations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
