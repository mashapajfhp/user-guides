# daily wage calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-21  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily wage calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Lack of Automated Salary Calculation**: The current system cannot automatically calculate salary based on actual working days, requiring manual interventions and separate tracking. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Formula**: The daily wage calculator in payroll settings intentionally overrides the formula configured in the leave policy for unpaid leave. The leave policy formula appears greyed out, indicating it is not active. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied for daily wage calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were calculated based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in incorrect payroll deduction amount. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Calculation Incorrect for Leap Years**: The End of Service (EOS) gratuity calculator incorrectly calculates service days by using 365 days instead of 366 days for 2024, resulting in an inaccurate total service period and gratuity amount. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Pro-Rated Amount Decimal Precision Error**: End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **EOS Gratuity Calculation Variance**: System gratuity calculation showed slight difference from manual calculation (System: AED 231,821, Manual: AED 252,485). Detailed calculation breakdown revealed system uses specific service duration and daily wage formula with tiered rates (21 days per year for first 5 years, 30 days per year after 5 years). _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Not Considering Leap Year Day**: The system's gratuity calculation may not transparently handle February 29th in leap years, causing minor discrepancies in total service days calculation (912 vs 913 days). _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Methodology Nuances**: The daily wage calculator's gratuity calculation involves complex logic for handling partial years of service, especially for periods above 5 years. The system uses specific methodologies for calculating service duration, including leap year adjustments and day count segmentation. _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Days Worked Mismatch**: Platform calculates total job tenure with a potential extra day (623 days vs expected 622 days). Daily wage calculation uses a fixed 30-day divisor, which differs from client's preferred method of (Basic × 12 / 365). _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Discrepancy**: System calculates leave salary based on predefined policy configuration, which may not align with user expectations about calendar days and prorated calculations. Users may misunderstand how daily wage is divided (31 vs 30 days) and challenge the resulting prorated salary amount. _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Monthly Leave Salary Accrual Inconsistency**: The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. The daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals. _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Inconsistency**: The system uses different divisors for leave salary and salary proration calculations. Leave salary uses a 30-day divisor while salary proration uses 30.42 days, causing calculation discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Calculation Confusion**: User initially misunderstood how working days are calculated based on work week configuration. The system was actually calculating correctly, but the user did not initially understand that their specific work week (NVK Operations) had all 7 days configured as working days. _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The system fails to correctly prorate salary when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing date. Proration works correctly for past departure dates but not for future dates. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Duplicate Payroll Deductions After Leave Recalculation**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Moving the leave request back to pending/accepted does not resolve the issue. Even after deleting the unpaid leave request entirely, the unpaid leave deduction persists in payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Inconsistency**: When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, the daily wage calculation becomes misaligned between the Time Off and Payroll modules. This causes incorrect salary deduction amounts due to a timing mismatch in working days calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Discrepancy**: The system calculates unpaid leave deductions using a custom daily wage divisor (30.42 days) instead of calendar days, which can produce deduction amounts that differ from user expectations _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Incorrect Days Displayed in Unpaid Leave Remarks**: The system displays incorrect number of days in remarks for February unpaid leave deduction - showing 31 days instead of 29 days, despite the underlying calculation being mathematically correct _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Daily Rate Configuration Overrides Policy Settings**: The system uses a global daily rate configuration that overrides individual policy-specific unpaid leave calculation methods, potentially leading to incorrect salary deductions. The global configuration takes precedence over policy-level settings, calculating deductions using a system-wide daily rate instead of policy-defined methods. _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Unpaid Leave Daily Rate Shows Incorrect Month**: The system displays the daily rate from the payroll processing month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate is from the wrong month. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Limitations

- **Fixed 26 Working Days Monthly Calculation**: Salary is based on a standard 26 working days per month, calculated from 365 annual days minus 52 weekly offs, resulting in 313 working days per year divided by 12 months. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Configuration Overrides Leave Policy**: Payroll daily wage calculator configuration supersedes leave policy formula for unpaid leave deductions _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Salary Configuration Dependency for Leave Deductions**: Leave deduction calculations depend on the timing of salary configuration creation relative to leave request submission. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Incorrect Handling of 366-Day Years**: System defaults to 365 days for all years, failing to recognize leap years with 366 days in gratuity calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Consistent Decimal Undercalculation**: Pro-rated amounts are consistently calculated with a slight decimal reduction, affecting all employees' End of Service calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Monthly Leave Accrual Limitation**: Leave days are only accrued at month-end under monthly accrual policy, preventing mid-month leave balance inclusion in EOS calculations _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Ambiguous Service Days Counting Rules**: Unclear rules for counting service days, specifically around departure date inclusion and leap year day handling. _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Complex Handling of Incomplete Service Years**: Calculation of gratuity for service periods above 5 years involves nuanced day counting, including special handling for incomplete years and leap year adjustments. _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- **Fixed Daily Wage Divisor**: Daily wage is calculated using a hardcoded divisor of 30 days (Basic/30), which cannot be modified or configured to alternative formulas _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Daily Wage Divisor Configuration**: Daily wage calculation follows a fixed policy setting that cannot be easily overridden, potentially causing discrepancies between user expectations and system calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-4731, TSSD-4368)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Depends on Working Days**: Leave encashment daily wage is calculated based on working days, which can vary month to month (e.g., 20 working days in February) _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Separate Calculation Methods for Leave and Proration**: Leave salary and salary proration use independently configured daily wage formulas, which cannot automatically align without manual intervention _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Based on Work Week Configuration**: Salary proration calculates based on days marked as working in the employee's assigned work week, which may include all 7 days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Limited Proration Logic for Future Departure Dates**: Salary proration only works accurately when departure date is in the past, not when it's in the future _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Inconsistent Deduction Handling**: Leave management and payroll deduction systems do not have a reliable mechanism for reconciling changes to leave transactions _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Lack of Real-Time Module Communication**: Time Off module does not automatically send complete leave request details to Payroll module at the time of calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Month-Specific Daily Rate Calculation**: Daily wage calculations are based on actual calendar days in the month, with specific handling for months with varying days (e.g., February in leap years) _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **System-Wide Settings Override Policy Configurations**: Users cannot customize leave deduction calculations at the policy level when a global setting exists _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Daily Rate Calculation Method**: Daily rate is calculated as (Basic + Allowances) / Working Days, excluding public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

- Leave request created in one month, payroll processed in another month — Potential misalignment of daily rate calculation and display _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Troubleshooting Notes

- Unable to automatically adjust salary based on working days — Cause: Current payroll system lacks dynamic salary calculation capabilities — Workaround: Use a mix of unpaid leaves and overtime, tracked separately for each employee _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- Greyed out formula in leave policy indicates override by payroll settings — Cause: Payroll daily wage calculator is configured to take precedence for unpaid leave calculations — Workaround: Verify daily wage calculator configuration in payroll settings to understand actual calculation method _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount — Cause: Deduction calculated based on outdated salary configuration — Workaround: Delete the leave request and recreate it if the deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Discrepancy in gratuity calculation between system and MOHRE reference — Cause: System incorrectly calculates service period by using 365 days for leap year instead of 366 days — Workaround: Manually adjust calculation to account for 366 days in 2024 _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- Pro-rated amounts show consistently lower values by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals — Cause: Decimal precision error in daily wage calculation formula (basic + allowances / 30) — Workaround: Development team has been escalated and the issue was reportedly resolved. Users should verify calculations after the fix. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Leave balance not automatically included for mid-month departure — Cause: Monthly accrual policy restricts leave day earning until month-end — Workaround: Manually adjust EOS balance in system or switch to conditional daily accrual policy _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Gratuity Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-1625, TSSD-2043)_
- Differences in gratuity calculation between manual and system methods — Cause: System uses specific methodology for counting days in partial years, including leap year adjustments (using 366 as divisor when applicable) — Workaround: Verify calculation by breaking down service period into segments: first 5 years at 21 days per year, subsequent years at 30 days per year, with pro-rata calculation for incomplete years _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- Discrepancy between expected and calculated leave salary — Cause: System calculates leave salary based on predefined daily rate configuration in leave policy, not user's manual calculation method — Workaround: Verify daily rate configuration in leave policy and understand the system's calculation logic before challenging the computed amount _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- Unexpected variations in leave salary accrual calculations — Cause: Daily wage calculator set to 'working days' method, which recalculates daily rate based on monthly working days — Workaround: Consider using 'custom days' setting for leave encashments to maintain consistent daily wage calculation _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Mismatched salary calculations between expected and system-generated amounts — Cause: Different divisors used for leave salary (30 days) and salary proration (30.42 days) — Workaround: Manually align daily wage configurations or use consistent divisor across calculations _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- Salary appears incorrectly prorated — Cause: Verify work week configuration to understand how working days are calculated — Workaround: Check employee's work week setup to confirm if all 7 days are marked as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- Full monthly salary displayed instead of prorated amount for future departure dates — Cause: Calculation logic does not account for departure date relative to payroll processing date — Workaround: Manually calculate prorated salary based on days worked until departure date _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Duplicate or persistent payroll deductions after modifying leave transactions — Cause: Lack of synchronization between leave management and payroll deduction systems — Workaround: Manual intervention required to remove orphaned or duplicate deductions _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Incorrect salary deduction for unpaid leave due to public holiday timing — Cause: Mismatch between Time Off and Payroll module calculations when public holidays are added after leave request — Workaround: Manual deduction adjustment or reopening previous payroll cycles (not recommended by customer) _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4368, TSSD-1753)_
- Discrepancy between displayed daily rate and actual calculation — Cause: Remarks field may show incorrect days, but actual deduction calculation remains accurate — Workaround: Verify actual deduction amount by calculating daily rate using correct calendar days (e.g., 28,700/29 = 989.66 for February) _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- Daily rate shows incorrect month for unpaid leave deduction — Cause: System recalculates daily rate based on payroll processing month instead of storing original leave occurrence month rate — Workaround: System deployed a fix to store and display the initially calculated daily rate _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_
