# daily wage calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-21  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily wage calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Lack of Automated Salary Calculation**: The current system cannot automatically calculate salary based on actual working days, requiring manual interventions and separate tracking. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Formula**: The daily wage calculator in payroll settings intentionally overrides the formula configured in leave policy for unpaid leave. The leave policy formula appears greyed out, indicating it is not actively used. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied for daily wage calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were incorrectly based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in payroll calculation discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-1581, TSSD-4368)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Calculation Incorrect for Leap Year**: The system incorrectly calculates service days by using 365 days instead of 366 days for 2024, resulting in an inaccurate gratuity amount. When calculating End of Service (EOS) gratuity, the system fails to recognize 2024 as a leap year, causing a calculation discrepancy of approximately AED 17.26. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **End of Service Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Error**: End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **EOS Gratuity Calculation Variance**: System gratuity calculation (AED 231,821) differs from manual calculation (AED 252,485), with support explaining the system calculation follows a specific service duration and daily wage formula _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Not Handling Leap Year Day Correctly**: The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently account for February 29th in leap years, causing a minor discrepancy in total service days calculation (912 vs 913 days). The difference impacts the final gratuity amount calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Inconsistent Days Calculation in Gratuity Computation**: Platform calculates total job tenure with a potential extra day (623 days instead of 622 days), causing slight variations in gratuity calculations. The discrepancy stems from how working days are counted and converted to years. _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Discrepancy in Leave Salary Calculation Days**: System calculates leave salary using a fixed daily rate divisor (potentially 30 days) which may not accurately reflect calendar month variations. User expected calculation based on 31 days, but system used a different configuration. _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Leave Salary Accrual Calculation Inconsistency**: The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. The daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals. _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Inconsistency**: The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using different daily wage divisors (30 vs 30.42 days), causing calculation discrepancies. Leave salary uses a 30-day divisor while salary proration uses 30.42 days, leading to different prorated amounts. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Calculation Confusion**: User misunderstood how working days are calculated based on work week configuration. The system was actually calculating correctly, but the user did not initially understand that their specific work week (NVK Operations) had all 7 days configured as working days. _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The daily wage calculator fails to correctly prorate salary when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing date. The system only correctly prorates salaries when departure dates are in the past. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Duplicate Payroll Deductions After Leave Request Modification**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Moving the leave request back to pending/accepted does not resolve the issue. Even after deleting the unpaid leave request entirely, the unpaid leave deduction persists in payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Mismatch**: Public holiday additions after leave request creation cause mismatches between HR and Payroll systems' daily wage calculations, resulting in incorrect salary deductions. The Time Off module does not send complete leave request details to the Payroll module at the time of calculation, causing data inconsistency when configuration changes occur mid-cycle. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Incorrect Days Displayed in Unpaid Leave Remarks**: The system displays incorrect number of days (31 instead of 29) in remarks for February unpaid leave deduction, despite the underlying calculation being mathematically correct. This is a display bug in the remarks field where the wrong number of days is referenced. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Mismatch**: The system applies a global daily rate configuration that overrides individual leave policy calculations, potentially causing incorrect salary deductions by using gross salary instead of basic salary. _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Unpaid Leave Daily Rate Incorrectly Displayed**: The system shows the daily rate from the payroll processing month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate is inconsistent with the leave period. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Limitations

- **Fixed 26 Working Days Monthly Calculation**: Salary is calculated based on a standard of 26 working days per month, derived from 365 annual days minus 52 weekly offs, resulting in 313 working days divided by 12 months. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Take Precedence Over Leave Policy**: Payroll daily wage calculator configuration overrides leave policy formula for unpaid leave calculations. The leave policy formula becomes non-editable (greyed out) when payroll settings are configured. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Salary Config Dependency in Leave Deduction**: Leave deduction calculations are dependent on the timing of salary configuration creation relative to leave request submission. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Incorrect Handling of 366-Day Years**: System defaults to 365 days per year, failing to recognize leap years in service period calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Decimal Precision Limitation in Pro-Rated Calculations**: Pro-rated amount calculations consistently produce results that are 0.1 or 0.2 less than expected, affecting all employees' End of Service calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Monthly Leave Accrual Constraint**: Leave days are only accrued at the end of the month, preventing prorated accrual for mid-month departures _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Service Duration Day Counting Rules**: Unclear rules for counting service days, including whether departure date is considered a working day and how leap year days are handled _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Hardcoded Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated using a fixed divisor of 30 days (Basic Salary / 30), which cannot be modified or configured to alternative formulas _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Inflexible Leave Salary Calculation**: The platform's leave salary calculation follows predefined policy configurations that cannot be easily overridden for specific scenarios. _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Leave Encashment Calculation Method Constraints**: Daily wage calculator uses working days as default calculation method, which causes monthly variations in leave salary accrual amounts _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Separate Daily Wage Calculation Methods**: The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using separate configurations that cannot be automatically aligned. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Daily Wage Proration Based on Work Week**: Salary proration is calculated based on the specific work week configuration, which may include all 7 days as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Limited Proration Logic for Future Departure Dates**: Salary proration only works correctly for departure dates in the past, not for future dates _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Inconsistent Deduction Handling in Leave Transactions**: The system cannot reliably manage payroll deductions when leave transactions are modified, deleted, or have status changes. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Inflexible Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated as (basic salary + allowance) / working days, where working days exclude weekends and public holidays specific to the employee's country of residence. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Custom Days Divisor for Wage Calculation**: Payroll system uses 30.42 days as divisor for daily wage calculation, not standard calendar days _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Month-Specific Daily Rate Calculation**: Daily wage calculations are based on actual calendar days in the month, with specific handling required for months with varying days (especially February in leap years). _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Settings Override Policy-Level Configurations**: The platform has a global configuration that supersedes individual policy-level settings for unpaid leave calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Daily Rate Calculation Method**: Daily rate is calculated as (Basic + Allowances) / Working Days, excluding public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

- Leave taken in one month, payroll processed in another month — Potential confusion in daily rate calculation and display _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Troubleshooting Notes

- Inability to automatically prorate salary for varying work days — Cause: Current payroll system lacks automated attendance-based salary calculation — Workaround: Use a mix of unpaid leaves and overtime tracking, managed separately for each employee _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- Inconsistent daily wage formula display between leave policy and payroll settings — Cause: Payroll settings intentionally override leave policy formula for unpaid leave calculations — Workaround: Verify daily wage calculator configuration in payroll settings; check that salary components and divisor (number of days) are correctly configured _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount — Cause: Deduction calculated based on outdated salary configuration — Workaround: Delete the leave request and recreate it if deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Gratuity amount lower than expected due to incorrect day count — Cause: System uses fixed 365-day year instead of recognizing 366 days in leap years — Workaround: Manually adjust calculation to use 366 days for leap years when computing service period _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- End of Service calculations show incorrect pro-rated amounts — Cause: Decimal precision error in daily wage calculation formula (basic + allowances / 30) — Workaround: Verify and manually adjust final settlement amounts to account for the systematic 0.1 or 0.2 decimal undercalculation _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Discrepancy between system and manual gratuity calculations — Cause: Complex calculation involving service duration split and different daily rates for different service periods — Workaround: Manually adjust EOS balance in the system or verify calculation details with support _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Gratuity Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-1625, TSSD-2043)_
- Discrepancy between expected and calculated leave salary amount — Cause: System calculates leave salary based on predefined policy configuration, which may use a fixed daily rate divisor — Workaround: Verify daily rate configuration in leave policy and understand the specific divisor used for salary calculations _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- Unexpected differences in monthly leave salary accrual totals — Cause: Daily wage calculator set to 'working days' method, which recalculates daily rate based on monthly working days — Workaround: Use 'custom days' setting for leave encashments to maintain consistent calculation _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Mismatched leave salary calculation compared to expected amount — Cause: Different daily wage divisors used for leave salary (30 days) and salary proration (30.42 days) — Workaround: Manually align daily wage configurations or adjust calculation method to use consistent divisor _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- Perceived incorrect salary proration — Cause: Verify work week configuration to understand how working days are calculated — Workaround: Check employee's assigned work week policy and confirm if all 7 days are marked as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- Full monthly salary displayed instead of prorated amount for offboarded employees — Cause: Calculation logic fails to handle departure dates relative to payroll processing date — Workaround: Manually calculate prorated salary based on days worked (Daily rate = Monthly salary / 30 * Days worked) _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Duplicate payroll deductions persist after leave request modification or deletion — Cause: Synchronization failure between leave management and payroll deduction systems — Workaround: Manual intervention required to remove orphaned or duplicate deductions from payroll _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave salary deduction — Cause: Timing mismatch between Time Off and Payroll modules when public holidays are added — Workaround: Manual deduction adjustment or reopening previous payroll cycles (not recommended) _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Deduction amount differs from expected monthly salary — Cause: System uses 30.42 days divisor: Daily wage = 4300/30.42 = 141.35, Total Deduction = 141.35 * 31 = 4,381.99 — Workaround: Understand that system uses custom days divisor for precise daily wage calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- Discrepancy between displayed daily rate and actual calculation — Cause: Calculation uses correct 29 days for February, but remarks field incorrectly shows 31 days — Workaround: Verify actual deduction amount against the calculated daily rate, not the remarks text _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- Unexpected salary deductions during unpaid leave — Cause: Global daily rate configuration overriding policy-specific calculation methods — Workaround: Verify global unpaid leave daily rate settings and understand their precedence over policy-level configurations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- Daily rate displayed does not match leave occurrence month — Cause: System recalculates daily rate based on payroll processing month instead of storing original leave occurrence month rate — Workaround: A fix was deployed to store the initially calculated daily rate and display that amount, avoiding recalculation _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_
