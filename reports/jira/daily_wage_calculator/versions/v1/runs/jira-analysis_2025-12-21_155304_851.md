# daily wage calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-21  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily wage calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Lack of Automated Working Days Salary Calculation**: Current system cannot automatically calculate salary based on actual working days, requiring manual interventions and separate tracking of overtime and unpaid leaves. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Inconsistent Daily Wage Formula Between Leave Policy and Payroll Settings**: The daily wage calculator in payroll settings overrides the leave policy formula for unpaid leave. The system shows a greyed-out formula in leave policy that is intentionally replaced by the payroll-side configuration. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were incorrectly based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in payroll calculation discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-1581, TSSD-4368)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Calculation Incorrect for Leap Years**: The system incorrectly calculates service days by using 365 days instead of 366 days for 2024, resulting in an inaccurate gratuity amount. The correct calculation should include 366 days for leap years. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **End of Service Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Error**: End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **EOS Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy**: System gratuity calculation shows slight differences from manual calculations, with complexity arising from service duration splits and tiered gratuity rates (21 days per year for first 5 years, 30 days per year after 5 years). _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy with Leap Year Days**: The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently handle leap year days (specifically February 29th), causing minor discrepancies in total service days and resulting gratuity amount. The system calculated 912 days, while manual calculation suggested 913 days by including the leap day. _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Days Worked Mismatch**: System calculates days worked with a potential extra day (622 vs 623 days), causing slight variations in gratuity calculation. The platform uses a fixed daily wage divisor of 30 days, which differs from client's preferred calculation method of (Basic × 12 / 365). _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Discrepancy in Leave Salary Calculation Days**: System calculates leave salary based on a fixed policy configuration that may not align with user expectations about calendar days. User believed daily wage should be divided by 31 days, but system was dividing by 30 days, resulting in a slight salary calculation difference (2940 SAR vs expected 2988 SAR). _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Leave Salary Proration Calculation Discrepancy**: The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using independent daily wage configurations with different divisors (30 vs 30.42 days), causing calculation mismatches. The leave salary policy uses a 30-day divisor while salary proration uses 30.42 days, leading to different prorated amounts. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Calculation Confusion**: User initially misunderstood how working days are calculated based on work week configuration. The system was actually calculating correctly, but the user did not initially understand that their specific work week (NVK Operations) had all 7 days configured as working days. _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The system fails to correctly prorate salary when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing date. When an employee is offboarded (e.g., on Nov 28th) and payroll is processed earlier (e.g., on Nov 27th), the system displays the full monthly salary instead of a prorated amount. The system only correctly prorates salaries when the departure date is in the past. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Duplicate Payroll Deductions After Leave Request Modification**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Moving the leave request back to pending/accepted does not resolve the issue. Even after deleting the unpaid leave request entirely, the unpaid leave deduction persists in payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, the daily wage calculation becomes inconsistent between Payroll and Time Off modules. This causes incorrect salary deduction amounts that cannot be retroactively corrected. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Incorrect Days Displayed in Unpaid Leave Remarks**: The system displays incorrect daily rate in remarks for February, showing 31 days instead of 29 days, despite the underlying calculation being mathematically correct. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Daily Rate Configuration Overrides Policy Settings**: The system applies a global daily rate configuration that supersedes individual leave policy settings for unpaid leave calculations. This can result in deductions calculated using gross salary instead of basic salary, contrary to policy configurations. _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Incorrect Daily Rate Month Display**: The system shows the daily rate from the payroll processing month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate is from the wrong month. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Limitations

- **Fixed 26 Working Days Monthly Salary Calculation**: Salary is based on a standard 26 working days per month, calculated using the formula: 365 (Days yearly) - 52 (Weekly off) = 313 / 12 = 26.08 working days _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Formulas**: For unpaid leave, the daily wage calculator configured in payroll settings takes precedence over the leave policy formula. The leave policy formula is greyed out and cannot be applied. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Salary Config Change Impact on Leave Deductions**: Leave deduction calculations may be incorrect if salary configuration is updated after leave request creation _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Incorrect Handling of 366-Day Years**: The system defaults to 365 days per year, failing to recognize leap years with 366 days in calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Decimal Precision Limitation in Pro-Rated Calculations**: Pro-rated amount calculations consistently produce results that are 0.1 or 0.2 less than expected, affecting all employees' End of Service calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Inflexible Monthly Leave Accrual**: Leave days are accrued at end of month, preventing prorated accrual for mid-month departures _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Ambiguity in Service Days Counting**: Unclear methodology for counting service days, including uncertainty about whether departure date counts as a working day _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated as: (basic salary + allowance) / working days, where working days exclude weekends and public holidays specific to the employee's country of residence. _(evidence: TSSD-2043, TSSD-4464)_
- **Inflexible Daily Wage Calculation Configuration**: The platform's leave salary calculation follows a fixed policy configuration that cannot be easily overridden for specific scenarios. _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Monthly Fluctuations in Daily Wage Calculation**: The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. This means the daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals. _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Separate Daily Wage Calculation Methods**: The platform calculates leave salary and salary proration using separate configurations that cannot automatically align without manual intervention. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Depends on Work Week Setup**: Daily wage proration is calculated based on the specific work week configuration, which can include all 7 days as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Limited Proration Date Handling**: Salary proration only works correctly for departure dates in the past, not for future departure dates _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Inconsistent Deduction Handling**: The system does not automatically remove or reconcile payroll deductions when leave requests are deleted or modified _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Fixed 30.42 Days Divisor for Wage Calculations**: System uses a fixed 30.42 days divisor for calculating daily wage, which may not align with calendar month days _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Monthly Day Count for Unpaid Leave Deduction**: Daily wage calculations use calendar days, which can vary by month (e.g., 29 days in February during leap years). _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Settings Override Policy-Level Configurations**: The platform has a global configuration that supersedes individual policy-level settings for unpaid leave calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Dynamic Daily Rate Calculation**: System recalculates daily rates based on payroll processing month instead of storing the original leave occurrence month rate _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Troubleshooting Notes

- Unable to automatically prorate salary based on working days — Cause: Current payroll system lacks built-in automation for working days-based salary calculation — Workaround: Use a mix of unpaid leaves and overtime tracking, managed separately for each employee _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- Discrepancy in daily wage formula between leave policy and payroll settings — Cause: Payroll settings are designed to take precedence for unpaid leave calculations, overriding leave policy formulas — Workaround: Verify and configure daily wage calculator in payroll settings first; understand that this configuration will override leave policy formulas _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount — Cause: Deduction calculated based on outdated salary configuration — Workaround: Delete the existing leave request and recreate it if deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Discrepancy in gratuity amount calculation — Cause: System using 365 days instead of 366 days for leap year calculations — Workaround: Manually verify and adjust calculation to include 366 days for leap years _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- End of Service calculations show slightly lower amounts than expected — Cause: Decimal precision error in daily wage calculation formula (basic + allowances / 30) — Workaround: Verify calculations manually and cross-check with development team's fix _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Leave balance not automatically included for mid-month departure — Cause: Monthly accrual policy restricts leave day inclusion for incomplete months — Workaround: Manually adjust EOS balance or switch to conditional daily accrual policy _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Gratuity Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-1625, TSSD-2043)_
- Discrepancy between expected and calculated leave salary amount — Cause: Leave salary is calculated based on daily rate configuration in the leave policy, with a predefined divisor that may not match user expectations — Workaround: Verify daily rate configuration in leave policy and understand the system's calculation logic before submitting leave requests _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- Unexpected differences in leave salary accrual totals across months — Cause: Daily wage calculator set to 'working days' method, which varies monthly — Workaround: Use 'custom days' setting for leave encashments to maintain consistent calculation _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Discrepancy between expected and system-calculated leave salary proration — Cause: Different divisors used for leave salary (30 days) and salary proration (30.42 days) — Workaround: Manually align daily wage configurations or verify specific calculation requirements with system configuration _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- Perceived incorrect salary proration — Cause: Verify work week configuration to understand how working days are calculated — Workaround: Check employee's assigned work week policy and confirm if all days are marked as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- Full monthly salary displayed for offboarded employees — Cause: Calculation logic fails to handle departure dates in future relative to payroll processing — Workaround: Manually adjust salary calculations to prorate based on exact departure date _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Duplicate or persistent payroll deductions after leave request modifications — Cause: Lack of synchronization between leave management and payroll deduction systems — Workaround: Manually review and remove orphaned deductions, contact system administrator for backend cleanup _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave salary deduction — Cause: Timing mismatch between public holiday addition and payroll calculation — Workaround: Manually add a deduction to correct the salary calculation, though not recommended by customers _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Deduction amount differs from expected monthly salary — Cause: Daily wage calculated as 4300/30.42 = 141.35, then multiplied by days in leave period — Workaround: Verify unpaid leave policy settings and understand the 30.42 days divisor method _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- Discrepancy between displayed daily rate and actual calculation — Cause: Remarks field shows incorrect days, but actual deduction calculation remains accurate — Workaround: Verify actual deduction amount by calculating daily rate using correct calendar days for the month _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- Unexpected salary deductions during unpaid leave — Cause: Global daily rate configuration overriding policy-specific calculation methods — Workaround: Verify global unpaid leave daily rate configuration and understand its precedence over policy settings _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- Unpaid leave deduction calculation appears inconsistent — Cause: Daily rate calculated as Basic + Allowances / Working Days, with working days excluding public holidays — Workaround: System deployed a fix to store the initially calculated daily rate and display that amount instead of recalculating _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_
