# daily_wage_calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-22  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily_wage_calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Lack of Automated Salary Calculation**: Current system cannot automatically calculate salary based on actual working days, requiring manual interventions and separate tracking of overtime and unpaid leaves. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Daily Wage Formula**: The daily wage calculator in payroll settings intentionally overrides the leave policy formula for unpaid leave. The leave policy formula appears greyed out, indicating it is not active. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied for daily wage calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were incorrectly based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in payroll deduction amount discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Calculator Leap Year Miscalculation**: The system incorrectly calculates service days by using 365 days instead of 366 days for leap years (specifically 2024), resulting in an inaccurate total service period and lower gratuity amount. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **End of Service Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Error**: Daily wage calculation for pro-rated amounts consistently produces slightly lower amounts due to decimal precision errors. When calculating End of Service (EOS) amounts, the system shows amounts less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. The formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but produces inaccurate results. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **EOS Gratuity Calculation Variance**: System gratuity calculation differs from manual calculations, with discrepancies in total amount and calculation methodology _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy with Leap Year Days**: The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently handle leap year days (specifically February 29th), causing minor discrepancies in total service days and resulting gratuity amount. The difference was minimal: system calculated 912 days (AED 14,691.95) vs manual calculation of 913 days (AED 14,708.05). _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Methodology Nuances**: The daily wage calculator's gratuity calculation involves complex logic for handling partial years of service, especially for periods above 5 years. The system uses specific methodologies for calculating days, accounting for leap years by potentially using 366 as a divisor, which can lead to slight calculation differences from manual calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- **Incorrect Days Worked in Gratuity Calculation**: System calculates days worked with a potential extra day (622 vs 623 days), which impacts gratuity calculation precision. The platform adds one extra day in length of service duration calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Leave Salary Accrual Calculation Inconsistency**: The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. The daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals. _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Inconsistency**: The system uses different daily wage divisors for leave salary (30 days) and salary proration (30.42 days), causing calculation discrepancies. This leads to different prorated amounts depending on the calculation method used. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Salary Proration Calculation Confusion**: User initially misunderstood the daily wage proration calculation. The system was actually calculating correctly based on the employee's work week configuration, where all 7 days were marked as working days, resulting in a full 31-day working month calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The system fails to correctly prorate salary when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing date. When an employee is offboarded (e.g., on Nov 28th) and payroll is processed earlier (e.g., Nov 27th), the system displays the full monthly salary instead of prorating it. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Persistent Payroll Deductions After Leave Request Deletion**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Deleting the leave request does not remove associated payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Inconsistency**: When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, there is a data synchronization issue between Time Off and Payroll modules. This causes mismatches in daily wage calculations, resulting in incorrect salary deductions that cannot be retroactively corrected. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Using Non-Standard Divisor**: The system calculates unpaid leave deductions using a custom daily wage divisor (30.42 days) instead of calendar days, which can produce deduction amounts that differ from user expectations _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Incorrect Days Displayed in Unpaid Leave Remarks**: The system displays incorrect number of days (31 days) in remarks for February, despite using the correct 29-day calculation for leap years. The actual deduction calculation remains mathematically accurate. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: Global daily rate configuration overrides policy-specific leave deduction calculations, potentially causing incorrect salary deductions by using gross salary instead of basic salary divided by working days. _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Unpaid Leave Daily Rate Calculation Shows Incorrect Month**: The system displays the daily rate from the payroll processing month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate is inconsistent with the leave period. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Limitations

- **Fixed 26 Working Days Monthly Calculation**: Salary is based on a standard 26 working days per month, calculated from 365 annual days minus 52 weekly offs, resulting in 313 working days per year divided by 12 months. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Configuration**: Payroll daily wage calculator configuration automatically overrides leave policy formula for unpaid leave calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Salary Config Change Impact on Leave Deductions**: Leave deduction calculations are dependent on salary configuration timing. If a new salary configuration is created after a leave request, the system may not automatically update the deduction amount. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Incorrect Leap Year Day Handling**: The system defaults to 365 days per year, failing to recognize leap years with 366 days in calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Precision Limitation**: Pro-rated amounts are calculated using (basic + allowances / 30), but suffer from consistent decimal precision errors affecting final settlement accuracy. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Monthly Leave Accrual Constraint**: Leave days are accrued at end of month, preventing prorated accrual for mid-month departures _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Ambiguity in Departure Date Counting**: Unclear rules about whether the departure date is counted as a working day in service duration calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Complex Handling of Incomplete Service Years**: The system calculates partial years differently for service periods above 5 years, using specific day counting and divisor selection methods that may not be intuitive to users. _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated using a hardcoded divisor of 30 days (Basic/30), which cannot be modified or configured to alternative formulas _(evidence: TSSD-2043, TSSD-3648)_
- **Separate Calculation Methods for Leave and Proration**: The system cannot automatically align leave salary and salary proration calculation methods without manual configuration _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Calculation Based on Work Week Configuration**: Daily wage proration is calculated based on the specific work week configuration, which may include all 7 days as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Inconsistent Salary Proration Based on Departure Date**: Salary proration only works correctly when departure date is in the past, not when it's in the future _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Incomplete Leave Transaction Deletion Handling**: When leave transactions are modified or deleted, the payroll deduction module does not automatically reconcile or remove associated deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated as: (basic salary + allowance) / working days, where working days exclude weekends and public holidays specific to the employee's country of residence. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Fixed 30.42 Days Divisor for Wage Calculations**: System uses a fixed 30.42 days divisor for daily wage calculations, which may not align with calendar month expectations _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Month-Specific Daily Rate Calculation**: Daily wage calculations are based on actual calendar days in the month, with specific handling for months with varying days (e.g., February in leap years). _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Settings Override Policy Configurations**: Global daily rate configuration automatically overrides individual policy-specific leave deduction calculation methods _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Daily Rate Calculation Method**: Daily rate calculated as Basic + Allowances / Working Days, excluding public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Troubleshooting Notes

- Unable to automatically adjust salary for varying work days — Cause: Current payroll system lacks dynamic salary calculation capabilities — Workaround: Use a mix of unpaid leaves and overtime tracking, managed separately for each employee _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- Daily Wage Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-2648, TSSD-2043, TSSD-2321)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount — Cause: Deduction calculated based on outdated salary configuration — Workaround: Delete the leave request and recreate it if the deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Gratuity Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-4179, TSSD-1625)_
- End of service amounts show less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals — Cause: Decimal precision error in daily wage calculation formula — Workaround: Development team has been escalated and the issue was reportedly resolved. Users should verify calculations after the fix. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Incomplete leave balance for mid-month departure — Cause: Monthly accrual policy prevents automatic prorating of leave days — Workaround: Manually adjust EOS balance or switch to conditional daily accrual policy _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Mismatch between manual and system gratuity calculations — Cause: Different methodologies for counting days in partial years, especially for periods above 5 years of service — Workaround: Verify exact service duration breakdown and understand system's day counting logic _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- Unexpected variations in leave salary accrual calculations — Cause: Daily wage calculator set to 'working days' method, which recalculates daily rate based on monthly working days — Workaround: Consider using 'custom days' setting for more consistent leave encashment calculations _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Perceived incorrect salary proration calculation — Cause: Work week configuration determines working days, which may include all 7 days for some organizations — Workaround: Verify work week configuration and understand how it impacts daily wage calculations _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- Full monthly salary displayed for partially worked month — Cause: System's proration logic does not account for departure date relative to payroll processing date — Workaround: Manually calculate prorated salary based on days worked (e.g., 21,000/30 * 15 days = 10,500 AED) _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Multiple payroll deductions for a single unpaid leave request — Cause: Synchronization failure between leave management and payroll systems during transaction modification — Workaround: Manual removal of orphaned payroll deductions may be required. Contact system administrator for backend cleanup. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave salary deduction due to public holiday timing — Cause: Mismatch between Time Off and Payroll module calculations when public holidays are added late — Workaround: Manual deduction adjustment or reopening previous payroll cycles (not recommended) _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4368, TSSD-1807)_
- Mismatch between displayed daily rate in remarks and actual calculation — Cause: Remarks field shows incorrect number of days, but underlying calculation uses correct calendar days — Workaround: Verify actual deduction amount by calculating daily rate using correct calendar days for the specific month _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- Unexpected salary deductions for unpaid leave — Cause: Global daily rate configuration overriding policy-specific calculation methods — Workaround: Verify global daily rate configuration and understand its precedence over policy-level settings _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
