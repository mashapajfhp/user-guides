# daily wage calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-23  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily wage calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Lack of Automated Salary Calculation**: Current system cannot automatically calculate salary based on actual working days, requiring manual interventions and separate tracking of overtime and unpaid leaves. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Inconsistent Daily Wage Formula Between Leave Policy and Payroll**: The system shows a discrepancy in daily wage formula configuration between leave policy and payroll settings. The payroll-side daily wage calculator takes precedence and overrides the leave policy formula for unpaid leave deductions. The greyed-out display in leave policy indicates this override is intentional. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were incorrectly based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in payroll calculation discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Calculation Incorrectly Handles Leap Years**: The End of Service (EOS) gratuity calculator is not correctly accounting for leap years in its calculation logic. When calculating gratuity for an employee with service spanning 2024 (a leap year), the system counts 365 days instead of 366 days for that year, resulting in an incorrect total service period (607 days instead of 608 days) and an incorrect gratuity amount (AED 10,476.98 instead of AED 10,494.24). _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **End of Service Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Error**: End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Complexity**: The daily wage calculator's gratuity calculation involves complex logic for handling partial years of service, especially for periods above 5 years. The system uses specific methodologies for counting days, accounting for leap years, and applying different daily rates based on service duration. _(evidence: TSSD-4742, TSSD-2252)_
- **Gratuity Amount Discrepancy in Leap Year**: The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently handle leap year days (February 29th), causing slight variations in total service days and resulting gratuity amount. The specific case showed a difference between 912 and 913 total days, impacting the final calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Inconsistent Days Calculation in Gratuity**: Platform calculates days worked with a potential extra day (623 days instead of 622 days). Daily wage calculation uses a fixed divisor of 30 days, which differs from client's preferred method of (Basic × 12 / 365). _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Leave Salary Accrual Calculation Inconsistency**: The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. The daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals. _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Divisor Mismatch**: The system uses different divisors for leave salary (30 days) and salary proration (30.42 days), causing calculation discrepancies. This is a system design limitation where leave salary and salary proration use independent daily wage formulas. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Calculation Confusion**: User initially misunderstood how working days are calculated based on work week configuration. The system was actually calculating correctly, but the user did not initially understand that their specific work week (NVK Operations) had all 7 days configured as working days. _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The system fails to correctly prorate salaries when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing. When payroll is processed earlier than the departure date, the system displays the full monthly salary instead of a prorated amount. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Persistent Payroll Deductions After Leave Request Deletion**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Deleting the leave request does not remove associated payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Inconsistency**: When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, the daily wage calculation becomes out of sync between Payroll and Time Off modules. This results in incorrect salary deduction amounts that cannot be retroactively corrected. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Unpredictable Deduction Calculations**: The payroll system uses a custom daily wage divisor (30.42 days) instead of calendar days, which can produce deduction amounts that differ from user expectations, potentially causing confusion about calculation methods. _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Incorrect Days Displayed in Unpaid Leave Remarks**: The system displays incorrect daily rate remarks for February, showing 31 days instead of 29 days (leap year), despite the underlying calculation being mathematically correct. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: The system applies a global daily rate configuration that overrides individual policy-specific unpaid leave calculation methods. Deductions are calculated using a global setting instead of policy-level basic salary / working days configuration. _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Incorrect Monthly Daily Rate Display**: The system shows the daily rate from the payroll processing month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate is inconsistent with the leave period. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Limitations

- **Fixed 26 Working Days Per Month Constraint**: Salary is calculated based on a standard 26 working days per month (365 annual days - 52 weekly offs = 313 working days / 12 months = 26.08 days) _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Formulas**: Payroll daily wage calculator configuration takes precedence over leave policy formula for unpaid leave calculations _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Salary Configuration Change Impact on Leave Deductions**: Leave deduction calculations are dependent on the timing of salary configuration creation relative to leave request submission. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Incorrect Handling of 366-Day Years in Calculations**: The system defaults to 365-day years, failing to recognize leap years with 366 days in service period calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Decimal Precision Limitation in Pro-Rated Calculations**: Pro-rated amount calculations consistently show amounts less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimal points across all employee calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Monthly Leave Accrual Limitation**: Leave days are accrued at end of month under monthly accrual policy, preventing mid-month leave balance inclusion in EOS _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Ambiguous Day Counting Methodology**: Unclear rules for counting service days, specifically around departure date inclusion and leap year day handling _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Complex Handling of Incomplete Service Years**: The system calculates partial years differently for service periods above 5 years, using specific day counting and divisor (365 or 366) based on leap year inclusion. _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- **Hardcoded Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated using a fixed divisor of 30 days (Basic/30), which cannot be modified or configured to alternative formulas _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Working Days vs Custom Days Leave Encashment Setting**: Leave encashment can be calculated using either 'working days' (variable monthly rate) or 'custom days' (consistent rate) _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Separate Configurations for Leave and Proration**: The Bayzat platform calculates leave salary and salary proration using independent daily wage configurations with different divisors. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Daily Wage Proration Based on Work Week**: Salary proration is calculated based on the specific work week configuration, which may include all 7 days as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Inconsistent Salary Proration Based on Departure Date**: Salary proration only works correctly for departure dates in the past, not for future departure dates _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Incomplete Transaction Reconciliation**: The system cannot automatically reconcile leave transactions with payroll deductions when modifications or deletions occur. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Retroactive Recalculation Not Supported**: The system cannot recalculate daily wage deductions retroactively when public holidays are added after leave request processing. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Custom Days Divisor for Wage Calculation**: System calculates daily wage by dividing monthly salary by 30.42 (custom days) instead of actual calendar days _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Month-Specific Daily Rate Calculation**: Daily wage calculations must use the actual number of calendar days in a specific month, with special handling for February in leap years. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Settings Override Policy Configurations**: The platform has a global configuration that supersedes individual policy-level settings for unpaid leave calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Daily Rate Calculation Method**: Daily rate is calculated as Basic + Allowances / Working Days, excluding public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Edge Cases

- Handling employees working more or fewer than 26 standard days — Potential salary calculation inaccuracies without automated proration _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- Employee Service Spanning a Leap Year (2024) — Incorrect gratuity calculation due to mishandling of 366-day year _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- Employee leaving mid-month with incomplete leave accrual — Potential loss of partial month's leave days in End of Service calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Uncertainty about whether departure date counts as a working day — Potential miscalculation of total service days _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- Handling of service periods spanning leap years — Potential calculation discrepancies when service includes partial leap years _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_

- Leave request created in one month, processed in another — Potential misalignment of daily rate calculation and display _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Troubleshooting Notes

- Need for manual tracking of overtime and unpaid leaves — Cause: Lack of automated salary calculation system — Workaround: Use a mix of unpaid leaves and overtime tracking separately for each employee _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- Inconsistent daily wage formula display between leave policy and payroll settings — Cause: Payroll settings intentionally configured to override leave policy formula for unpaid leave calculations — Workaround: Verify daily wage calculator configuration in payroll settings to understand actual applied formula _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount — Cause: Deduction calculated based on outdated salary configuration — Workaround: Delete the existing leave request and recreate it if the deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Gratuity Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-4179, TSSD-2043)_
- End of Service calculations show slightly lower amounts than expected — Cause: Decimal precision error in daily wage formula calculation (basic + allowances / 30) — Workaround: Ticket was escalated to development team and resolved _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Leave balance not automatically included for mid-month departure — Cause: Monthly accrual policy restricts leave day inclusion for incomplete months — Workaround: Manually adjust leave balance in EOS section or switch to conditional daily accrual policy _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Discrepancy between system-calculated and client-edited gratuity amount — Cause: System calculates gratuity based on specific methodology, but allows manual client editing — Workaround: Verify calculation methodology and confirm total service days before manual override _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- Differences between manual and system gratuity calculations — Cause: System uses specific methodology for counting days and applying different daily rates based on total service duration — Workaround: Verify calculation by breaking down service period into segments (before and after 5 years), accounting for leap years _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- Cumulative leave salary accrual amounts differ between months — Cause: Daily wage calculator set to use working days, which varies the daily rate based on monthly working days count — Workaround: Change leave encashment setting to 'custom days' for consistent calculation _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Mismatch between expected and system-calculated leave salary — Cause: Different divisor configurations for leave salary (30 days) and salary proration (30.42 days) — Workaround: Manually align leave salary and salary proration daily wage configurations to use consistent divisors _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- Apparent incorrect salary proration calculation — Cause: Proration is calculated based on work week configuration, which may include all 7 days as working days — Workaround: Verify work week configuration and understand that all days marked as working will result in full month calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- Full salary displayed for partially worked month — Cause: Calculation logic does not account for departure date relative to payroll processing date — Workaround: Manually calculate prorated salary based on days worked (daily rate = monthly salary / 30 * days worked) _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Duplicate or persistent payroll deductions after leave request changes — Cause: Synchronization failure between leave management and payroll systems — Workaround: Manually review and remove duplicate deductions, as system does not auto-reconcile _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Incorrect salary deduction for unpaid leave — Cause: Timing mismatch between public holiday addition and leave request processing — Workaround: Manual deduction adjustment or reopening previous payroll cycles (not recommended) _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Deduction amount differs from expected monthly salary — Cause: System uses 30.42 day divisor to calculate daily wage: (Monthly Salary / 30.42) * Days of Leave — Workaround: Manually verify daily wage calculation using system's configured divisor of 30.42 days _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- Unpaid Leave Deduction Verification _(evidence: TSSD-1301, TSSD-1753)_
- Daily rate shows incorrect month for unpaid leave deduction — Cause: System recalculates daily rate based on payroll processing month instead of storing original leave occurrence month rate — Workaround: A fix was deployed to store the initially calculated daily rate and display that amount, avoiding recalculation _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_
