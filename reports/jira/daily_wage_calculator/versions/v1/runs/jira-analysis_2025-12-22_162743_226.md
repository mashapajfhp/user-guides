# daily_wage_calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-22  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily_wage_calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Lack of Automated Salary Calculation**: The current system cannot automatically calculate salary based on actual working days, requiring manual interventions and separate tracking of overtime and unpaid leaves. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Discrepancy Between Leave Policy and Payroll Daily Wage Calculation**: The daily wage calculator in payroll settings overrides the formula in the leave policy for unpaid leave. The leave policy formula appears greyed out, indicating it is being superseded by the payroll configuration. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were calculated based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in incorrect payroll deduction amount. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Calculation Incorrect for Leap Years**: The system incorrectly calculates service days by using 365 days instead of 366 days for leap years (specifically 2024), resulting in an inaccurate total service period and lower gratuity amount. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **End of Service Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Error**: End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **EOS Gratuity Calculation Variance**: System gratuity calculation (AED 231,821) slightly differs from manual calculation (AED 252,485). Detailed calculation breakdown shows system uses a specific formula: daily wage divided by 30, with 21 days per year for first 5 years and 30 days per year after, prorating partial years by days/365. _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy in Leap Year**: System may not consistently handle leap year days (Feb 29th) when calculating total service days for gratuity computation. The ticket revealed a minor difference in day counting: client calculated 913 total days (including leap day), while system initially showed 912 days, resulting in a slight gratuity amount variation. _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Incorrect Days Worked in Gratuity Calculation**: System calculates 623 days instead of 622 days when computing employee service tenure, potentially affecting gratuity calculation accuracy. The extra day discrepancy impacts the final gratuity amount calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Leave Salary Accrual Report Calculation Inconsistency**: The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. The daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals. _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Inconsistency**: The system uses different divisors for leave salary and salary proration calculations. Leave salary uses a 30-day divisor, while salary proration uses a 30.42-day divisor, causing calculation discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Salary Proration Calculation Confusion**: User initially misunderstood how working days are calculated based on work week configuration. The system was actually calculating correctly, but the user did not initially understand that their specific work week (NVK Operations) had all 7 days configured as working days. _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The daily wage calculator fails to correctly prorate salaries when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing. The system only prorates salaries when departure dates are in the past, causing incorrect full salary calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Duplicate Payroll Deductions After Leave Recalculation**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Moving the leave request back to pending/accepted does not resolve the issue. Even after deleting the unpaid leave request entirely, the unpaid leave deduction persists in payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Inconsistency**: When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, the daily wage calculation becomes inconsistent between Payroll and Time Off modules. This causes incorrect salary deduction amounts that cannot be retroactively corrected. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Using Non-Standard Divisor**: The system calculates daily wage for unpaid leave using a custom divisor of 30.42 days instead of calendar days, which can produce deduction amounts that differ from user expectations _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Incorrect Days Displayed in Unpaid Leave Remarks**: The platform displays incorrect remarks for daily wage calculations in February, showing 31 days instead of the actual 29 days for leap years. The backend calculation remains accurate, but the frontend display creates potential user confusion. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Daily Rate Configuration Overrides Policy Settings**: The system has a global daily rate configuration that overrides individual leave policy calculations. This means unpaid leave deductions are calculated using a system-wide setting instead of policy-specific methods, potentially leading to incorrect salary deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Unpaid Leave Daily Rate Incorrectly Displayed**: The system shows the daily rate from the payroll processing month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate is from the wrong month. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Limitations

- **Fixed 26 Working Days Monthly Calculation**: Salary is based on a standard 26 working days per month, calculated from 365 annual days minus 52 weekly offs, resulting in 313 working days divided by 12 months. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Formulas**: Payroll daily wage calculator configuration takes precedence over leave policy formulas for unpaid leave calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Leave Deduction Calculation Dependent on Salary Config Timing**: Unpaid leave deductions are calculated based on the salary configuration existing at the time of leave request creation. Changes to salary configuration after leave request may not automatically update deduction calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Incorrect Handling of Leap Year Days in Service Calculations**: The system defaults to 365 days per year, failing to recognize leap years with 366 days in service period calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Decimal Precision in Daily Wage Calculations**: Daily wage calculations (basic + allowances / 30) consistently produce slightly lower amounts due to decimal precision limitations. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Monthly Leave Accrual Constraint**: Leave days are accrued at end of month, meaning mid-month departures do not automatically include current month's leave balance _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Service Duration Day Counting Rules**: Unclear rules for counting service days, including whether departure date is considered a working day and how leap year days are processed _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Fixed Daily Wage Divisor Limitation**: Daily wage is calculated using a hardcoded divisor of 30 days (Basic/30), which cannot be modified or configured to alternative formulas _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Leave Encashment Calculation Based on Monthly Working Days**: Leave salary accrual is calculated using a 'working days' method, which means the daily wage varies based on the number of working days in each month _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Separate Calculation Methods for Leave and Proration**: Leave salary and salary proration use separate daily wage configurations that cannot be automatically aligned. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Working Days Calculation Based on Work Week**: Salary proration is calculated based on the specific work week configuration, which can include all 7 days as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Limited Proration Date Handling**: Salary proration is only accurate for departure dates in the past, not for future departure dates _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Incomplete Transaction Reconciliation**: The system does not automatically remove or reconcile payroll deductions when leave transactions are modified, deleted, or have their status changed. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated as: (basic salary + allowance) / working days, where working days exclude weekends and public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Payroll and Time Off Module Integration**: Time Off module does not automatically send complete leave request details to Payroll module at the time of calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Fixed 30.42 Days Divisor for Wage Calculations**: Payroll system uses a fixed 30.42 days divisor for daily wage calculations, which may not align with calendar months _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **February Days Calculation Limitation**: The system may default to 31 days when calculating daily rates, potentially causing display inaccuracies in leap years like February with 29 days. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Settings Supersede Policy-Level Configurations**: The platform has a global configuration that supersedes individual policy-level settings for unpaid leave calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Daily Rate Calculation Method**: Daily rate is calculated as (Basic + Allowances) / Working Days, excluding public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Troubleshooting Notes

- Inability to automatically adjust salary based on worked days — Cause: Current payroll system lacks dynamic salary calculation capabilities — Workaround: Use a mix of unpaid leaves and overtime tracking, managed separately for each employee _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- Inconsistent daily wage formula display across leave policy and payroll settings — Cause: Payroll settings are designed to take precedence for unpaid leave calculations, with leave policy formulas becoming read-only — Workaround: Verify daily wage calculator configuration in payroll settings to understand the actual applied formula _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount — Cause: Deduction calculated based on outdated salary configuration — Workaround: Delete the leave request and recreate it if the deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Gratuity Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-4179, TSSD-2043)_
- End of Service amounts consistently show 0.1 or 0.2 less than expected — Cause: Decimal precision error in daily wage calculation formula (basic + allowances / 30) — Workaround: Ticket was escalated to development team and resolved _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Leave balance not automatically included for mid-month departure — Cause: Monthly accrual policy restricts leave day inclusion for incomplete months — Workaround: Manually adjust EOS balance in the system or use conditional accrual policy for daily leave earning _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Discrepancy between system-calculated and client-edited gratuity amounts — Cause: System allows manual editing of automatically calculated gratuity amounts without clear validation — Workaround: Verify manual calculations against system's automated computation, paying special attention to day counting methodology _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- Unexpected differences in monthly leave salary accrual calculations — Cause: Daily wage calculator is set to use 'working days' method, causing monthly variations — Workaround: Consider using 'custom days' setting for more consistent leave encashment calculations _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Discrepancy between expected and system-calculated leave salary — Cause: Different divisors used for leave salary (30 days) and salary proration (30.42 days) — Workaround: Manually align daily wage configurations or use system's existing separate configurations with awareness of potential calculation differences _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- Perceived incorrect salary proration — Cause: Proration based on work week configuration where all days are marked as working days — Workaround: Verify work week configuration and understand how working days are defined for the specific employee or organization _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- Full monthly salary displayed for partially worked month — Cause: Proration logic fails when departure date is in future relative to payroll processing date — Workaround: Manually calculate prorated salary based on days worked until departure date _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Persistent payroll deductions after leave request deletion — Cause: Synchronization failure between leave management and payroll systems — Workaround: Manual intervention may be required to remove duplicate or incorrect deductions _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Salary deduction amount differs from expected full month salary — Cause: Mismatched working days calculation due to late public holiday addition — Workaround: Manual deduction adjustment or reopening previous payroll cycles (not recommended) _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Deduction amount differs from expected monthly salary — Cause: Daily wage calculated as monthly salary (4300) divided by 30.42, resulting in 141.35 per day, then multiplied by days of leave — Workaround: Verify unpaid leave policy settings and understand the 30.42 days divisor calculation method _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- Discrepancy between displayed daily rate and actual calculation — Cause: Remarks field shows incorrect number of days, but underlying calculation uses correct calendar days — Workaround: Verify actual deduction amount by calculating daily rate using correct number of calendar days for the specific month _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- Unpaid leave deductions calculated using gross salary instead of basic salary — Cause: Global daily rate configuration overrides policy-specific calculation method — Workaround: Verify global unpaid leave daily rate configuration before investigating policy-level discrepancies _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- Daily rate shows incorrect month for unpaid leave deduction — Cause: System recalculates daily rate based on payroll processing month instead of storing original leave occurrence month rate — Workaround: System deployed a fix to store initially calculated daily rate and display that amount instead of recalculating _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_
