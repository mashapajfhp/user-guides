# daily wage calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-17  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily wage calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence also links this feature to salary proration for partial months (e.g., joiners, leavers, resignations). Evidence also connects daily-rate behaviour to end-of-service (EOS) and gratuity/leave-encashment settlement scenarios. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks or payslip day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Leave Salary Accrual Report Calculation Discrepancies**: Daily wage calculations in leave salary accrual report use calendar days, which may not match custom accounting formulas _(evidence: TSSD-1227)_
- **Incorrect Remarks Display for February Daily Wage Calculation**: Platform displays incorrect remarks for daily wage calculations, showing 31 days instead of 29 days for February in leap years _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Bug**: System fails to automatically recalculate unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations are created after leave request submission _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Leap Year Day Calculation Discrepancy in Gratuity**: The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently handle leap year days, causing minor differences in total service days and final gratuity amount _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
