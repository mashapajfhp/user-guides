# daily_wage_calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-22  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily_wage_calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Lack of Automated Salary Calculation**: Current system cannot automatically calculate salary based on actual working days, requiring manual interventions and separate tracking. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Discrepancy in Daily Wage Formula Between Leave Policy and Payroll Settings**: The system shows a greyed-out formula in the leave policy that is overridden by the daily wage calculator configured in payroll settings. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied for unpaid leave deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were incorrectly based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in payroll calculation discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Leap Year Miscalculation**: The End of Service (EOS) gratuity calculator incorrectly handles leap years by defaulting to 365 days instead of 366 days for 2024, resulting in an inaccurate total service period and gratuity amount calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Pro-Rated End of Service Amount Calculation Error**: End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **EOS Gratuity Calculation Variance**: System gratuity calculation (AED 231,821) slightly differs from manual calculation (AED 252,485), with detailed breakdown showing system follows a specific calculation logic _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy with Leap Year Days**: The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently handle leap year days (specifically February 29th), causing minor discrepancies in total service days calculation. The system calculated 912 days, while manual calculation suggested 913 days by including the leap day. _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Methodology Nuances**: The daily wage calculator's gratuity calculation involves complex logic for handling partial years of service, especially for periods above 5 years. The system calculates service duration with specific rules for leap years, using 366 as a divisor when the partial year includes a leap year, which can differ from manual calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- **Discrepancy in Days Worked Calculation**: System calculates 623 days instead of 622 days when computing job tenure, potentially causing slight variations in gratuity calculation. An extra day seems to be added incorrectly to the total working days. _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Discrepancy in Leave Salary Calculation**: System calculates leave salary based on predefined policy configuration, which may not align with user expectations about calendar days. The specific case showed a calculation using 30 days instead of 31 days, resulting in a slight salary amount difference (2940 SAR vs expected 2988 SAR). _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Inconsistency**: The system uses different divisors for leave salary and salary proration calculations. Leave salary uses a 30-day divisor, while salary proration uses a 30.42-day divisor, causing calculation discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Misinterpretation of Working Days Calculation**: User initially misunderstood how working days are calculated based on work week configuration. The system calculates proration correctly using the configured work week, which in this case had all 7 days marked as working days. _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The system fails to correctly prorate salaries when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing. When payroll is processed earlier than the departure date, the system displays the full monthly salary instead of prorating based on actual working days. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Duplicate Payroll Deductions After Leave Recalculation**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Deleting the leave request does not remove associated payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, there is a timing mismatch between the Time Off and Payroll modules. This causes inconsistent daily wage calculations, resulting in incorrect salary deduction amounts that cannot be retroactively corrected. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Method**: The system calculates unpaid leave deductions using a custom daily wage divisor (30.42 days) instead of calendar days, which can produce deduction amounts that differ from user expectations _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Incorrect Days Display in Unpaid Leave Remarks**: The system displays incorrect number of days (31 instead of 29) in remarks for February unpaid leave calculations, despite the actual calculation being mathematically correct. This is a display bug in the remarks field where the wrong number of days is referenced. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Daily Rate Configuration Overrides Policy Settings**: The system applies a global daily rate configuration that supersedes individual leave policy calculations, potentially causing incorrect unpaid leave deductions by using gross salary instead of basic salary _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Unpaid Leave Daily Rate Shows Incorrect Month**: The system displays the daily rate from the payroll processing month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate is inconsistent with the leave period. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Limitations

- **Fixed 26 Working Days Monthly Calculation**: Salary is based on a 26 working days per month standard, calculated as 365 (Days yearly) - 52 (Weekly off) = 313 / 12 = 26.08 working days _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Daily Wage Formulas**: For unpaid leave, the daily wage calculator in payroll settings takes precedence over the leave policy formula. The leave policy formula is greyed out and cannot be used. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Salary Configuration Dependency in Leave Deduction**: Leave deduction calculations depend on salary configuration timing. If a new salary configuration is created after a leave request, the system may use outdated salary information for deduction calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Incorrect Leap Year Day Handling**: System defaults to 365 days for all years, failing to recognize leap years with 366 days in gratuity calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Pro-Rated Salary Calculation Precision Limitation**: Daily wage calculations (basic + allowances / 30) consistently produce slightly lower amounts due to decimal precision handling. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Inflexible Leave Accrual for Mid-Month Departures**: Leave days are only accrued at month-end, preventing prorated accrual for mid-month departures _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Service Days Calculation Ambiguity**: Unclear rules for counting service days, including departure date and leap year days _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Precise Service Period Measurement**: The system calculates service duration with granular precision, breaking down service periods into specific segments (e.g., years, months, days) with special handling for incomplete years and leap years. _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- **Fixed Daily Wage Divisor**: Daily wage is calculated using a fixed divisor of 30 days (Basic/30), which cannot be modified or configured to alternative formulas _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Inflexible Daily Wage Calculation Method**: The platform's leave salary calculation follows predefined policy configurations that cannot be easily overridden for specific scenarios. _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Monthly Fluctuations in Daily Wage Calculation**: The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. This means the daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals. _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Separate Calculation Methods for Leave and Proration**: The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using independent configurations that cannot be automatically aligned. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Based on Work Week Configuration**: Daily wage proration is calculated based on the specific work week configuration, which may include all 7 days as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Inconsistent Salary Proration Based on Departure Date**: Salary proration only works correctly when departure date is in the past, not when it's in the future _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Inability to Automatically Remove Deductions**: When leave transactions are modified or deleted, the payroll deduction module does not automatically reconcile or remove associated deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated as: (basic salary + allowance) / working days, where working days exclude weekends and public holidays specific to the employee's country of residence. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **No Automatic Retroactive Corrections**: The system cannot automatically recalculate salary deductions retroactively when configuration changes occur after initial calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Custom Days Divisor for Wage Calculation**: System uses 30.42 days as divisor for daily wage calculation, not standard calendar days _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Month-Specific Daily Rate Calculation**: Daily wage calculations are based on the actual calendar days in a month, with specific handling required for months with varying days (especially February in leap years). _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Settings Override Policy-Level Configurations**: The platform has a global configuration that supersedes individual policy-level settings for unpaid leave calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Daily Rate Calculation Method**: Daily rate is calculated as (Basic + Allowances) / Working Days, excluding public holidays. Working days are determined by subtracting public holidays from total calendar days. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

- Daily Wage Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-2648, TSSD-2321)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction calculation based on outdated salary configuration — Cause: System did not automatically update pending leave deductions when salary configuration changed — Workaround: Delete the leave request and recreate it if the deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Gratuity Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-4179, TSSD-2043)_
- End of Service pro-rated amounts show incorrect decimal values — Cause: Systematic rounding error in daily wage calculation formula — Workaround: Development team has been escalated and the issue was reportedly resolved. Users should verify calculations after the fix. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Discrepancy between system and manual gratuity calculations — Cause: Complex calculation involving service duration split and tiered daily rates — Workaround: Manual adjustment possible in EOS section for exceptional cases _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Discrepancy in total service days calculation — Cause: Uncertainty about whether departure date counts as a working day and how leap year days are handled — Workaround: Manually verify total service days, considering departure date and leap year days _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- Difference between manual and system gratuity calculations — Cause: System uses precise day counting method with special handling for partial years and leap years, which may differ from manual calculation approaches — Workaround: Verify calculation by breaking down service period into specific segments, accounting for leap years and using the appropriate divisor (366 for leap years) _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- Discrepancy in leave salary amount — Cause: Salary calculated based on daily rate configuration in leave policy, with a fixed divisor that may not match user expectations — Workaround: Verify daily rate configuration in leave policy and understand the system's calculation logic _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- Discrepancies in monthly leave salary accrual totals — Cause: Daily wage calculator configured to use working days, causing calculation variations — Workaround: Use custom days setting for leave encashments to maintain more consistent calculations _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Perceived incorrect salary proration — Cause: System calculates working days based on work week configuration, which may include all 7 days as working days — Workaround: Verify work week configuration to understand how working days are calculated for salary proration _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_

- Duplicate payroll deductions persist after leave request deletion or modification — Cause: Lack of synchronization between leave management and payroll deduction systems — Workaround: Manual intervention required to remove orphaned or duplicate deductions _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Salary deduction amount differs from expected full month salary — Cause: Mismatch between Time Off and Payroll module calculations due to late public holiday additions — Workaround: Manual deduction adjustment or waiting for future module communication enhancement _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Deduction amount does not match expected monthly salary — Cause: Daily wage calculated as 4300/30.42 = 141.35, then multiplied by days in leave period — Workaround: Manually add/adjust amounts to balance payroll calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- Discrepancy between displayed daily rate and actual calculation — Cause: Calculation uses correct calendar days (29 for February), but remarks display might show incorrect day count — Workaround: Verify actual deduction amount against system calculation, not just the remarks text _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- Unpaid leave deductions calculated using incorrect salary component (gross instead of basic) — Cause: Global daily rate configuration overrides policy-specific calculation methods — Workaround: Verify and adjust global daily rate configuration to ensure correct unpaid leave deduction calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- Discrepancy in daily rate display across different payroll months — Cause: System recalculates daily rate based on payroll processing month instead of storing the original leave occurrence month rate — Workaround: Verify daily rate matches the leave occurrence month by checking the initially calculated rate at the time of leave request _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_
