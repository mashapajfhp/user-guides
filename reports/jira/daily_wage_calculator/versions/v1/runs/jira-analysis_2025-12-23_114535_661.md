# daily_wage_calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-23  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily_wage_calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Lack of Automated Salary Calculation**: The current system lacks automated salary calculation based on precise working days, requiring manual tracking and interventions for overtime and unpaid leaves. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Daily Wage Formula**: The daily wage calculator in payroll settings intentionally overrides the leave policy formula for unpaid leave. The leave policy formula appears greyed out, indicating it is not active. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied for daily wage calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were incorrectly based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in payroll calculation discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-1581, TSSD-4368)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Leap Year Miscalculation**: The system incorrectly calculates service days by using 365 days instead of 366 days for leap years (specifically 2024), resulting in an inaccurate total service period and reduced gratuity amount. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Pro-Rated End of Service Amount Calculation Error**: End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **EOS Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy**: System gratuity calculation shows slight differences from manual calculations due to complex service duration and daily wage formula _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Not Considering Leap Year Days**: The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently handle leap year days (specifically February 29th), potentially causing minor discrepancies in service duration calculations. The system calculated 912 days, while manual calculation suggested 913 days including the leap day. _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Incorrect Days Calculation in Gratuity Computation**: System calculates one extra day in job tenure (622 vs 623 days), potentially affecting gratuity calculation precision. The platform captures 623 days instead of the expected 622 days when computing years of service. _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Discrepancy**: System calculates leave salary based on predefined policy configuration, which may not align with user expectations about calendar days and prorated calculations. Users may misunderstand how daily wage is divided (31 vs 30 days) and resulting prorated salary amount. _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Leave Salary Accrual Calculation Inconsistency**: The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. The daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals. _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Inconsistency**: The system uses different divisors for leave salary and salary proration calculations. Leave salary uses a 30-day divisor, while salary proration uses a 30.42-day divisor, causing calculation discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Calculation Confusion**: User initially misunderstood how working days are calculated based on work week configuration. The system was actually calculating correctly, but the user did not initially understand that their specific work week (NVK Operations) had all 7 days configured as working days. _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The system fails to correctly prorate salaries when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing date. When processing payroll earlier than the departure date, the system displays the full monthly salary instead of a prorated amount. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Persistent Payroll Deductions After Leave Request Deletion**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Deleting the leave request does not remove associated payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Inconsistency**: When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, there is a timing mismatch between Payroll and Time Off modules causing incorrect daily wage calculations. The system cannot recalculate deductions retroactively, leading to inconsistent salary deduction amounts. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Incorrect Days Displayed in Unpaid Leave Remarks**: The system displays incorrect number of days (31 instead of 29) in the remarks section for February unpaid leave calculations, despite the backend calculation being mathematically correct. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: The system applies a global daily rate configuration that overrides individual leave policy settings for unpaid leave deductions. Instead of using Basic Salary / Working Days as configured, the system uses a global daily rate that calculates deductions using gross salary, potentially leading to incorrect salary deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Incorrect Daily Rate Display Across Payroll Months**: The system recalculates daily rates based on the payroll processing month instead of storing and displaying the rate from the original leave occurrence month, causing user confusion. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Limitations

- **Fixed 26 Working Days Monthly Calculation**: Salary is based on a standard 26 working days per month, calculated from 365 annual days minus 52 weekly offs, resulting in 313 working days per year divided by 12 months. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Take Precedence Over Leave Policy**: Payroll daily wage calculator configuration overrides leave policy formula for unpaid leave calculations. The payroll-side configuration always takes precedence. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Salary Config Dependency in Leave Deduction**: Unpaid leave deduction calculations are dependent on the timing of salary configuration creation relative to leave request submission. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Incorrect Leap Year Day Counting**: System defaults to 365 days per year, failing to recognize 366 days in leap years during service period calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Decimal Precision Limitation in Pro-Rated Calculations**: Daily wage calculations consistently produce amounts that are 0.1 or 0.2 less than expected when computing pro-rated End of Service amounts. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Limited Mid-Month Leave Accrual Handling**: Leave days are only accrued at the end of the month, preventing prorated accrual for mid-month departures _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Service Duration Calculation Rules**: Unclear rules for counting service days, including whether departure date is considered a working day and how leap year days are handled _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Fixed Daily Wage Computation Method**: Daily wage is calculated using a hardcoded divisor of 30 days (Basic/30), which cannot be modified or configured to alternative formulas _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Inflexible Daily Wage Divisor**: The platform uses a fixed divisor for daily wage calculation based on policy configuration, which cannot be easily overridden for specific scenarios. _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Monthly Variation in Daily Wage Calculation**: Leave encashment calculations are based on working days, which means the daily wage rate changes each month depending on the number of working days _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Separate Calculation Methods for Leave and Proration**: The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using separate configurations that cannot be automatically aligned _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Depends on Work Week Setup**: Salary proration is calculated based on the specific work week configuration, which can include all 7 days as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Inconsistent Salary Proration Based on Departure Date**: Salary proration works correctly only when departure date is in the past, but fails when departure date is in the future _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Incomplete Transaction Reconciliation**: The system does not automatically reconcile or remove payroll deductions when leave transactions are modified or deleted. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated as: (basic salary + allowance) / working days, where working days exclude weekends and public holidays specific to the employee's country of residence. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Fixed 30.42 Days Divisor for Wage Calculation**: Unpaid leave policy uses a fixed 30.42 day divisor instead of calendar days for daily wage calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Month-Specific Daily Rate Calculation**: Daily wage calculations are based on the actual calendar days in a month, with specific handling required for months with varying days (especially February in leap years). _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Settings Override Policy-Level Configurations**: The platform has a global configuration that supersedes individual policy-level settings for unpaid leave calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Daily Rate Calculation Method**: Daily rate is calculated as Basic + Allowances / Working Days, excluding public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

- Handling 7-day work weeks with public holidays affecting daily wage calculations — Incorrect daily rate calculation when work schedules include varying work weeks and public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- Leave request created in one month, payroll processed in another month — Incorrect daily rate display and potential user confusion _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Troubleshooting Notes

- Inability to automatically adjust salary based on working days — Cause: Lack of automated payroll calculation workflow — Workaround: Manually track unpaid leaves and overtime separately for each employee _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- Daily Wage Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-2648, TSSD-2321)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount — Cause: Deduction calculated based on outdated salary configuration — Workaround: Delete the leave request and recreate it if the deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Discrepancy in gratuity amount calculation — Cause: System incorrectly calculates service days by using 365 days instead of 366 days for leap years — Workaround: Manually verify and adjust calculation to include 366 days for leap years _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- Pro-rated End of Service amounts show consistently lower amounts by small decimal points — Cause: Decimal precision issue in daily wage calculation formula (basic + allowances / 30) — Workaround: Manually verify and potentially adjust final settlement amounts _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Discrepancy between system and manual gratuity calculations — Cause: Complex calculation involving service duration tiers and daily wage formula — Workaround: Manually adjust EOS balance in the system or verify calculation details with support _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Discrepancy between system-calculated and manually edited gratuity amount — Cause: System calculates gratuity based on specific logic, but allows manual editing by users — Workaround: Verify calculation method and manually adjust if needed _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- Discrepancy between manual and system gratuity calculations — Cause: Fixed daily wage divisor (30 days) and precise days worked calculation method differ from manual computation approaches — Workaround: Manually verify system calculations, especially for complex employment tenures _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- Discrepancy between expected and calculated leave salary — Cause: System calculates leave salary based on predefined policy configuration, which uses a fixed daily rate divisor — Workaround: Verify daily rate configuration in leave policy and understand the system's calculation logic _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- Unexpected differences in monthly leave salary accrual totals — Cause: Daily wage calculator is set to use working days for leave encashment, causing monthly variations — Workaround: Consider using custom days setting for more consistent leave encashment calculations _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Perceived incorrect salary proration calculation — Cause: System calculates working days based on work week configuration, which can include all 7 days as working days — Workaround: Verify employee's work week configuration to understand proration calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- Full monthly salary displayed for offboarded employees — Cause: Calculation logic does not handle departure dates relative to payroll processing date — Workaround: Manually adjust salary calculations or wait for system fix _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Duplicate payroll deductions persist after leave request deletion — Cause: Lack of automatic cleanup in leave-to-payroll synchronization logic — Workaround: Manual intervention required to remove orphaned payroll deductions _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Incorrect salary deduction for unpaid leave — Cause: Mismatch between Payroll and Time Off module calculations due to late public holiday additions — Workaround: Manual deduction adjustment or waiting for future module enhancement to improve synchronization _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Deduction amount differs from expected monthly salary — Cause: System uses 30.42 days divisor to calculate daily wage: (4300/30.42 = 141.35 daily rate) × 31 days = 4,381.99 AED — Workaround: Understand that system uses a custom divisor (30.42 days) for daily wage calculation, which may result in deductions slightly different from monthly salary _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- Discrepancy between displayed daily rate and actual calculation — Cause: Remarks field shows incorrect number of days, but underlying calculation remains accurate — Workaround: Verify actual deduction amount by calculating daily rate using correct calendar days (29 for February in leap years) _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- Discrepancies in unpaid leave deduction calculations — Cause: Global daily rate configuration overriding policy-specific calculation methods — Workaround: Verify global unpaid leave daily rate settings and understand their precedence over policy-level configurations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- Daily rate shows incorrect month for leave deduction — Cause: System recalculates daily rate based on payroll processing month instead of leave occurrence month — Workaround: A fix was deployed to store the initially calculated daily rate and display that amount _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_
