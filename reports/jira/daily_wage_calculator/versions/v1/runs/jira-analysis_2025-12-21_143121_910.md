# daily wage calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-21  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily wage calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Lack of Automated Salary Calculation**: Current system does not support automatic salary calculation based on actual working days, requiring manual interventions and separate tracking. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Formula**: The daily wage calculator in payroll settings intentionally overrides the leave policy formula for unpaid leave. The leave policy formula appears greyed out, indicating it is not the active calculation method. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were calculated based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in incorrect payroll deduction amount. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Calculation Incorrect for Leap Years**: The system incorrectly calculates service days by using 365 days instead of 366 days for 2024, resulting in an inaccurate gratuity amount. When calculating End of Service (EOS) gratuity, the system fails to recognize 2024 as a leap year, causing a calculation discrepancy of approximately AED 17.26. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **End of Service Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Error**: Daily wage calculation for pro-rated amounts produces consistently lower amounts by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. The formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but results in slightly incorrect End of Service (EOS) calculations across all employees. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **EOS Gratuity Calculation Variance**: System gratuity calculation (AED 231,821) slightly differs from manual calculation (AED 252,485). Detailed breakdown shows system calculation follows specific service duration and daily wage formula rules. _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy with Leap Year Days**: The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently handle leap year days (specifically February 29th), causing minor discrepancies in total service days calculation. The system calculated 912 days, while the manual calculation included 913 days by explicitly counting the leap day. _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Days Worked Calculation Inconsistency**: System calculates 623 days instead of 622 days when computing gratuity, adding one extra day to the total job tenure calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Discrepancy in Leave Salary Calculation Days**: System calculates leave salary using a predefined daily rate configuration that may not align with user expectations about calendar days. The specific case showed a calculation dividing daily wage by 30 days instead of 31 days, resulting in a slight salary amount difference (2940 SAR vs expected 2988 SAR). _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Leave Salary Accrual Calculation Inconsistency**: The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. The daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals. _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Inconsistency**: The system uses different divisors for leave salary (30 days) and salary proration (30.42 days), causing calculation discrepancies. Leave salary and salary proration are configured independently, leading to potential mismatches in daily wage calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Calculation Confusion**: User initially misunderstood how working days are calculated based on work week configuration. The system was actually calculating correctly, but the user did not initially understand that their specific work week (NVK Operations) had all 7 days configured as working days. _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The system fails to correctly prorate salaries when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing date. When an employee is offboarded (e.g., on Nov 28th) and payroll is processed earlier (e.g., on Nov 27th), the system displays the full monthly salary instead of a prorated amount. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Duplicate Payroll Deductions After Leave Request Modification**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Moving the leave request back to pending/accepted does not resolve the issue. Even after deleting the unpaid leave request entirely, the unpaid leave deduction persists in payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Inconsistency**: The system experiences data synchronization problems between Time Off and Payroll modules when public holidays are added after leave requests. This causes mismatches in daily wage calculations, resulting in incorrect salary deductions that cannot be retroactively corrected. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Unpredictable Deduction Calculations**: The system uses a custom daily wage divisor (30.42 days) instead of calendar days, which can produce deduction amounts that differ from user expectations, potentially causing confusion about calculation methods. _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Incorrect Days Displayed in Unpaid Leave Remarks**: The system displays incorrect daily rate remarks for February, showing 31 days instead of 29 days (leap year), despite the underlying calculation being mathematically correct. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Daily Rate Configuration Overrides Policy Settings**: The system applies a global daily rate configuration that supersedes individual leave policy calculations for unpaid leave deductions. This results in deductions being calculated using a system-wide setting instead of policy-specific methods. _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Incorrect Daily Rate Month Display**: The system shows the daily rate from the payroll month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate does not reflect the month when leave occurred. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Limitations

- **Fixed 26 Working Days Monthly Calculation**: Salary is based on a standard 26 working days per month (313 working days per year, calculated as 365 - 52 weekly offs) _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Take Precedence**: Payroll daily wage calculator configuration overrides leave policy formula for unpaid leave calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Salary Config Change Impact on Leave Deductions**: Leave deduction calculations may be incorrect if salary configuration is changed after leave request creation _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Incorrect Handling of Leap Year Days in Service Calculations**: The system defaults to 365 days per year, failing to dynamically adjust for leap years when calculating total service period. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Pro-Rated Calculation Formula**: Daily wage is calculated as (basic + allowances) / 30, which may not account for precise decimal representations _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Monthly Leave Accrual Constraints**: Leave days are accrued at end of month under monthly policy, meaning incomplete months are not automatically included in End of Service (EOS) calculations _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Ambiguity in Days Counting Methodology**: Unclear rules for counting service days, including whether departure date is considered a working day and how leap year days are handled _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Fixed Daily Wage Divisor**: Daily wage is calculated using a hardcoded divisor of 30 days (Basic/30), which cannot be modified or configured to alternative formulas _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Inflexible Leave Salary Calculation Method**: The platform's leave salary calculation follows predefined policy configurations that cannot be easily overridden for specific scenarios. _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Based on Working Days**: Leave encashment daily wage is calculated based on the number of working days in a month, which can vary _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Separate Calculation Methods for Leave and Proration**: The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using independent daily wage configurations with different divisors. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Daily Wage Proration Based on Work Week**: Salary proration calculates based on days marked as working in the employee's assigned work week configuration _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Inconsistent Salary Proration Based on Departure Date**: Proration only works correctly when departure date is in the past; fails for future departure dates _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Inconsistent Deduction Handling in Leave Transactions**: The system does not automatically reconcile or remove payroll deductions when leave requests are modified, deleted, or have their status changed. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated as: (basic salary + allowance) / working days, where working days exclude weekends and public holidays specific to the employee's country of residence. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Custom Days Divisor for Wage Calculation**: System calculates daily wage by dividing monthly salary by 30.42 (custom days) instead of using exact calendar days _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Month-Specific Daily Rate Calculation**: Daily wage calculations must account for varying number of days in different months, particularly February in leap years. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Settings Override Policy-Level Configurations**: The platform has a global configuration that supersedes individual policy-level settings for unpaid leave calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Daily Rate Calculation Method**: Daily rate calculated as (Basic + Allowances) / Working Days, excluding public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Troubleshooting Notes

- Unable to automatically adjust salary based on worked days — Cause: Current payroll system lacks dynamic attendance-based salary calculation — Workaround: Use a mix of unpaid leaves and overtime tracking, managed separately for each employee _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- Inconsistent Daily Wage Formula Display — Cause: Payroll settings use different salary components (basic + allowances) compared to leave policy (basic only) — Workaround: Verify daily wage calculator configuration in payroll settings to understand the active formula _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount — Cause: Deduction calculated based on outdated salary configuration — Workaround: Delete the existing leave request and recreate it if the deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Discrepancy in gratuity amount due to incorrect day counting — Cause: System uses fixed 365-day year calculation, ignoring leap year specifics — Workaround: Manually verify and adjust calculation to use 366 days for 2024, consulting MOHRE guidelines _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- End of Service calculations show amounts less than expected by small decimal points — Cause: Rounding or precision issue in daily wage calculation formula — Workaround: Manually verify and potentially adjust final settlement amounts _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Leave balance not automatically included for mid-month departure — Cause: Monthly accrual policy restricts automatic prorating of leave days — Workaround: Manually adjust leave balance in EOS section or switch to conditional daily accrual policy _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Gratuity Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-1625, TSSD-2043)_
- User confusion about how daily wage is divided for leave salary — Cause: Calculation follows predefined policy configuration, not actual calendar days — Workaround: Verify daily rate configuration in leave policy settings before submitting leave request _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- Inconsistent leave salary accrual calculations across months — Cause: Daily wage calculator set to 'working days' method — Workaround: Use 'custom days' setting for leave encashments to potentially achieve more consistent calculations _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Discrepancy between expected and system-calculated leave salary — Cause: Different divisors used for leave salary (30 days) and salary proration (30.42 days) — Workaround: Manually align daily wage configurations or verify specific calculation method for each scenario _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- Perceived incorrect salary proration — Cause: Verify work week configuration to understand how working days are calculated — Workaround: Check employee's work week setup to confirm working days configuration _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- Full salary displayed instead of prorated amount for offboarded employees — Cause: System's inability to handle departure dates in future relative to payroll processing — Workaround: Manually calculate prorated salary based on daily rate: (Monthly Salary / 30) * Days Worked _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Payroll deductions remain after deleting leave request — Cause: Synchronization failure between leave management and payroll systems — Workaround: Manual removal of duplicate deductions may be required. Contact system administrator for backend cleanup. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount — Cause: Mismatch between public holiday configuration and leave request timing — Workaround: Manual deduction adjustment or reopening previous payroll cycles (not recommended) _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Deduction amount exceeds expected monthly salary — Cause: Daily wage calculated as 4300/30.42 = 141.35, then multiplied by days in leave period (31 days = 4,381.99) — Workaround: Verify unpaid leave policy settings and understand the 30.42 days divisor used in calculations _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- Incorrect daily rate displayed in remarks — Cause: System defaulting to 31 days instead of using actual calendar days for the month — Workaround: Verify actual deduction amount, not just the remarks text. Confirm calculation uses correct number of calendar days. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- Unexpected salary deduction during unpaid leave — Cause: System uses global daily rate configuration instead of policy-specific calculation — Workaround: Verify global unpaid leave daily rate settings and understand their precedence over policy configurations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- Daily rate shows incorrect month, causing user confusion — Cause: System recalculates daily rate based on current payroll month instead of storing original leave occurrence month rate — Workaround: Verify daily rate matches leave occurrence month; check stored daily rate versus recalculated rate _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_
