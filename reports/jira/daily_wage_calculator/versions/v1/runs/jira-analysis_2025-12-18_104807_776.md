# daily wage calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-18  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily wage calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Values Missing in Leave Salary Accrual Report**: Values are missing in columns M and N (Accrued Days, Provision Accrued for the month) of the Leave salary accrual report. The daily wage calculation uses calendar days, which may not match custom accounting requirements. _(evidence: TSSD-1227)_
- **Incorrect Days Displayed in Unpaid Leave Remarks**: The system displays incorrect daily rate in remarks for February, showing 31 days instead of 29 days (leap year), despite the underlying calculation being mathematically correct. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were calculated based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in incorrect payroll deduction amount. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy with Leap Year Days**: The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently handle leap year days (February 29th), causing minor discrepancies in total service days and resulting gratuity amount. The system calculated 912 days, while manual calculation showed 913 days by including the leap day. _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: The system applies a global daily rate configuration that overrides individual policy-specific leave calculation methods. Unpaid leave deductions are calculated using a global setting instead of policy-level basic salary / working days configuration. _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Incorrect Days Worked in Gratuity Calculation**: System calculates 623 days instead of 622 days when computing length of service, potentially adding an extra day to gratuity calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Methodology Nuances**: The system's gratuity calculation involves complex logic for handling partial years of service, especially for periods above 5 years. The calculation differs from manual expectations by using specific day counting and leap year adjustment methods. _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- **Leave Salary Calculation Mismatch**: The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using independent daily wage configurations with different divisors (30 vs 30.42 days), causing calculation discrepancies. This means the same employee's salary can be prorated differently depending on whether it's a leave salary or regular salary proration. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Salary Proration Miscalculation**: System calculates salary proration incorrectly by using 30 days instead of actual calendar days (31 days in August), and does not automatically recalculate prorations when daily rate configuration changes after employee offboarding. _(evidence: TSSD-2518)_
- **Persistent Payroll Deductions After Leave Request Deletion**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Deleting the leave request does not remove associated payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **End of Service Calculation Challenges**: The system automatically generates EOS deductions and salary arrears without precise proportional recalculation for employees with non-standard employment status changes, causing potential calculation discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-2597)_
- **End of Service Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Error**: Daily wage calculation for pro-rated amounts consistently produces slightly lower amounts due to decimal precision errors. When calculating End of Service (EOS) amounts, the system shows amounts less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Payroll Settings Overwrite Leave Policy Daily Wage Formula**: The daily wage calculator in payroll settings overrides the leave policy formula for unpaid leave. The greyed-out formula in leave policy indicates that the payroll configuration takes precedence, causing user confusion about which formula is actually being applied. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Multiple Leave Salary Policy Interaction Bugs**: Two distinct bugs in leave salary policy configuration: (1) Changes to daily rate calculation in leave salary policy did not take effect until another leave salary policy was set to inactive, indicating incorrect policy precedence or caching issue when multiple leave salary policies exist. (2) Leave salary request was generated for a 5-day leave despite the policy requiring minimum 21 days, indicating the minimum days threshold validation is not working correctly. _(evidence: TSSD-2934)_
- **Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The system fails to correctly prorate salaries when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing. When an employee is offboarded (e.g., Nov 28th) and payroll is processed earlier (e.g., Nov 27th), the system displays the full monthly salary instead of a prorated amount. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Incorrect Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is currently being calculated based on basic salary, whereas it should be calculated using gross pay. This represents an incorrect calculation methodology for leave salary accrual reporting. _(evidence: TSSD-3487)_
- **Inappropriate GOSI Component Appearance**: A GOSI (social security) component is incorrectly appearing on reports for a UAE client who has not configured any social security contributions. _(evidence: TSSD-3487)_
- **Leave Salary Accrual Inconsistency**: The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals across different months _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Incorrect Daily Wage Calculation in Leave Salary Accrual Report**: The system is not applying the configured leave encashment calculation method to the accrual report generation. Reports continue to calculate daily wage based on working days instead of the configured formula (Basic + allowances / 30 days). _(evidence: TSSD-3779)_
- **EOS Daily Wage Calculation Inconsistency**: System calculates daily wage by dividing total compensation by 21 working days instead of the expected 22 working days in the leave policy. This results in a different End of Service (EOS) calculation amount for employees. _(evidence: TSSD-3832)_
- **End of Service Leave Encashment Calculation Configuration UI Inconsistency**: When configuring leave encashment calculation, the End of Service Eligibility section does not immediately or clearly reflect configuration changes, causing user confusion about whether settings have been successfully applied. _(evidence: TSSD-3939)_
- **Unable to Edit Automatically Created Leave Deductions**: System prevents administrators from editing or deleting automatically generated annual leave deductions in End of Service (EOS) calculations. Specifically, attempts to set deduction amounts to zero fail, and the system does not save changes. _(evidence: TSSD-3946)_
- **Incorrect End of Service Calculations for Mid-Month Leavers**: The system does not accurately calculate End of Service (EOS) settlements for employees leaving mid-month with unpaid leave. It calculates EOS deductions using full monthly salary instead of the actual prorated amount paid. _(evidence: TSSD-4033)_
- **Unclear Prorated Salary Calculation Process**: The current salary proration calculation lacks transparency in showing detailed calculation steps. Users cannot easily see how working days are counted and how the proration formula is applied. _(evidence: TSSD-4129)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Calculation Incorrectly Handles Leap Years**: The End of Service (EOS) gratuity calculator does not correctly account for leap years in its calculation logic. When calculating gratuity for an employee with service spanning 2024 (a leap year), the system counts 365 days instead of 366 days, resulting in an incorrect total service period and gratuity amount. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Proration Calculation Misunderstanding**: User initially misunderstood how working days are calculated based on work week configuration. The system was actually calculating correctly, but the user did not initially understand that their specific work week (NVK Operations) had all 7 days configured as working days. _(evidence: TSSD-4292, TSSD-4303)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Confusion**: The system uses a custom daily wage divisor (30.42 days) instead of calendar days, which can produce deduction amounts that differ from user expectations, potentially causing confusion about calculation methods. _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Salary Deduction**: When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, the daily wage calculation becomes inconsistent between Payroll and Time Off modules. This causes incorrect salary deduction amounts that cannot be retroactively corrected. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Discrepancy in Leave Salary Calculation Days**: System calculates leave salary based on a fixed daily rate configuration in policy, which may differ from user expectations about calendar days. The specific ticket showed a calculation using 30 days instead of 31 calendar days, resulting in a slight salary amount difference (2940 SAR vs expected 2988 SAR). _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **System vs Manual Gratuity Calculation Difference**: Discrepancy between system gratuity calculation (AED 231,821) and manual calculation (AED 252,485) for end of service benefits _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Incorrect Gratuity Calculation for Limited Contracts**: The system is producing inconsistent gratuity calculations for limited contract employees. The expected calculation (1200/30*21*2 = 1680 AED) does not match the system's generated amount. Calculation accuracy depends on departure reason and contract type. _(evidence: TSSD-4796)_
- **Lack of Customized Salary Proration Methods**: The system currently applies a single proration approach across all employees, preventing differentiated calculation methods for distinct employee groups (Head Office vs Operations). _(evidence: TSSD-4882)_
- **Inconsistent UI Display for Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: When 'Overwrite' option is enabled in Payroll Configuration → Daily Wage → Unpaid Leave Deduction, the Leave Policy UI shows 'Basic/calendar' while the actual calculation uses 'Basic + Allowance/calendar' from the payroll configuration. This creates user confusion about which calculation method is actually being applied. _(evidence: TSSD-4947)_
- **Missing Hourly Wage Information in Salary Configuration**: The current salary configuration does not support hourly wage input, which limits detailed compensation management for users with hourly-based employees or complex wage structures. _(evidence: OS-3079)_

### Limitations

- **Fixed Calendar Day Calculation Method**: Leave salary accrual report is hardcoded to use actual calendar days for calculations, preventing custom divisor configurations _(evidence: TSSD-1227)_
- **Leap Year Day Calculation in Daily Wage**: Daily wage calculations must use the actual number of calendar days in a month, with special handling for February in leap years (29 days). _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Leave Deduction Calculation Depends on Salary Config Timing**: Unpaid leave deductions are calculated based on salary configuration existing at the time of leave request creation. Changes to salary configuration after leave request may not automatically update deduction calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Ambiguous Service Day Counting Methodology**: Unclear rules for counting service days, including whether departure date is considered a working day and how leap year days are handled _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Global Settings Override Policy Configurations**: The platform has a global configuration that supersedes individual policy-level settings for unpaid leave calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated as (basic salary + allowances) / 30, which may not always produce precisely accurate pro-rated amounts. _(evidence: TSSD-2043, TSSD-2605, TSSD-3648, TSSD-4464)_
- **Nuanced Handling of Incomplete Service Years**: System uses specific methodology for calculating gratuity in partial years, including:
1. Different calculation for first 5 years (21 days per year)
2. Different calculation for years above 5 years (30 days per year)
3. Special handling of incomplete final year using day-based prorated calculation
4. Leap year adjustment using 366 days divisor when applicable _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- **Separate Calculation Methods for Leave and Proration**: The platform calculates leave salary and salary proration using independent configurations that cannot be automatically aligned _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Calculation Locked After Offboarding**: Prorated salary calculations are locked based on the daily rate configuration at the time of employee offboarding, preventing dynamic updates. _(evidence: TSSD-2518)_
- **Incomplete Transaction Management**: The system does not automatically reconcile or remove payroll deductions when leave transactions are modified or deleted. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Complex Employment Status Calculation Handling**: System cannot automatically adjust EOS deductions and salary arrears for employees with offboarding and rehiring in consecutive months _(evidence: TSSD-2597)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Formulas**: Payroll daily wage calculator configuration takes precedence over leave policy formulas for unpaid leave calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Conflicting Leave Salary Policy Handling**: Multiple active leave salary policies can cause unexpected behavior in daily rate calculations and minimum days threshold enforcement. _(evidence: TSSD-2934)_
- **Inconsistent Salary Proration Based on Departure Date**: Salary proration only works correctly when departure date is in the past, failing for future departure dates _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Inflexible Daily Wage Calculation**: Current system does not allow flexible selection of salary base (basic vs gross) for daily wage calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-3487)_
- **Inflexible Leave Salary Calculation Method**: The system struggles to consistently apply custom leave encashment calculation methods across different reporting components. _(evidence: TSSD-3779)_
- **Inflexible Public Holiday Treatment in Working Days Calculation**: The system automatically uses actual working days in a month, which may not align with predefined leave policy standards. _(evidence: TSSD-3832)_
- **Salary Basis for Leave Encashment Calculation**: Leave encashment calculation can be configured using basic salary or basic salary with allowances, but the UI may not clearly reflect the selected method _(evidence: TSSD-3939)_
- **Restricted Calculation Method for Daily Wage**: Current system limits daily rate calculation to Basic salary, preventing calculation based on Gross pay _(evidence: TSSD-3946)_
- **Inflexible EOS Settlement Calculation**: System rigidly calculates EOS using full monthly salary without considering actual days worked or payment received. _(evidence: TSSD-4033)_
- **Complex Working Days Calculation**: Prorated salary calculation requires precise configuration of workweek, public holidays, and leave management to accurately determine working days _(evidence: TSSD-4129)_
- **Incorrect Handling of 366-Day Years in Calculations**: System defaults to 365 days per year, failing to recognize leap years with 366 days in service period calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Working Days Calculation Depends on Work Week Setup**: Daily wage proration is calculated based on the specific work week configuration, which can include all 7 days as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Fixed Proration Calculation Approach**: The platform lacks configurable proration calculation methods, using a single approach of calculating working days _(evidence: TSSD-4303)_
- **Custom Days Divisor for Wage Calculation**: System uses 30.42 days as the divisor for daily wage calculation, not standard calendar days _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Time Off and Payroll Module Synchronization**: Time Off module does not send complete leave request details to Payroll module at the time of calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Inflexible Leave Salary Calculation**: Leave salary calculation is rigidly tied to predefined policy configurations, which cannot be easily overridden for specific scenarios _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- **Monthly Leave Accrual Constraint**: Leave days are only accrued at the end of the month, preventing prorated accrual for mid-month departures _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Departure Reason Impacts Calculation Accuracy**: Gratuity calculations are dependent on departure reason and contract type, leading to inconsistent results. _(evidence: TSSD-4796)_
- **Uniform Proration Calculation Across Employee Groups**: Current system applies identical salary proration calculation for all employees, regardless of employee type _(evidence: TSSD-4882)_
- **Payroll Configuration Overrides Leave Policy Settings**: When 'Overwrite' option is enabled in Payroll Configuration, leave policy settings cannot be edited and the payroll configuration takes precedence. _(evidence: TSSD-4947)_
- **Incomplete Salary Configuration Options**: The platform cannot currently record or manage hourly wage details within the salary configuration section _(evidence: OS-3079)_
- **Daily Rate Configuration Limitation**: The current Leave Encashment module does not allow direct configuration of Daily Rate within the Daily Rate Calculator. This creates an additional step or potential workflow friction for payroll administrators. _(evidence: OS-446)_

- Employee leaving mid-month with incomplete leave accrual — Potential employee dissatisfaction with leave balance treatment _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_

### Troubleshooting Notes

- Unable to use custom daily wage divisor in leave salary accrual report — Cause: Report is designed for finance/accounting managers using calendar-based accrual calculations — Workaround: Manually edit exported report:
1. Change days in month (column J)
2. Divide column I by column J to get desired value
3. Recalculate subsequent columns using the adjusted values _(evidence: TSSD-1227)_
- Discrepancy between displayed daily rate and actual calculation — Cause: Remarks field shows incorrect number of days, but actual calculation uses correct calendar days — Workaround: Verify actual deduction amount by calculating daily rate using correct number of calendar days for the specific month _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount — Cause: Deduction calculated based on outdated salary configuration — Workaround: Delete the leave request and recreate it if the deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Gratuity Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-1625, TSSD-2043, TSSD-4179)_
- Unexpected unpaid leave deduction amounts — Cause: Global daily rate configuration overrides policy-level calculation settings — Workaround: Verify global unpaid leave daily rate settings before investigating policy-specific calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- Difference in gratuity calculation between manual method and system calculation — Cause: System uses precise day counting method, including:
1. Calculating exact days in partial years
2. Using 366 days divisor for leap years
3. Segmenting service period into different calculation tiers — Workaround: Verify calculation by breaking down service period into specific segments:
1. First 5 years: 21 days per year
2. Years above 5: 30 days per year
3. Use precise day count for partial years
4. Account for leap year in day divisor _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- Daily Wage Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-2321, TSSD-2648, TSSD-3832)_
- Incorrect prorated salary calculation after daily rate configuration change — Cause: System does not automatically update proration when daily rate settings are modified post-offboarding — Workaround: Rehire and re-offboard the employee to trigger recalculation of prorated amounts with the new daily rate configuration _(evidence: TSSD-2518)_
- Duplicate or orphaned payroll deductions after leave request modifications — Cause: Lack of synchronization between leave management and payroll deduction systems — Workaround: Manually review and remove duplicate deductions; contact system administrator for backend cleanup _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Incorrect salary arrears and EOS deduction for employees with complex employment status — Cause: System automatically deducts full salary amount and recalculates proportionally based on working days — Workaround: Manual adjustment of arrear amount may be required; cannot delete platform-generated EOS deduction _(evidence: TSSD-2597)_
- End of service amounts show slightly lower values than expected — Cause: Decimal precision error in daily wage calculation formula — Workaround: Verify final settlement amounts manually and cross-check with expected calculations _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Daily rate calculation changes not taking effect — Cause: Multiple active leave salary policies prevent proper policy change propagation — Workaround: Deactivate other leave salary policies before making configuration changes _(evidence: TSSD-2934)_
- Full monthly salary shown for partially worked month — Cause: System does not dynamically adjust salary based on departure date relative to payroll processing — Workaround: Manually calculate prorated salary (e.g., Total monthly salary / 30 * days worked) _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Incorrect daily wage calculations in leave salary accrual reports — Cause: System using basic salary instead of gross pay for daily wage calculations — Workaround: Manually adjust calculations or contact support for correction _(evidence: TSSD-3487)_
- Inconsistent leave salary accrual totals across months — Cause: Daily wage calculator set to use working days, which varies monthly — Workaround: Switch to 'custom days' setting for more consistent leave encashment calculations _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Leave salary accrual report shows incorrect daily wage calculation — Cause: Potential frontend or cache issues preventing correct application of configured calculation method — Workaround: Verify backend response and potentially invalidate cache to ensure correct calculation method is applied _(evidence: TSSD-3779)_
- End of Service Eligibility section shows outdated calculation method — Cause: Potential UI synchronization issue or delayed configuration update — Workaround: Verify configuration by checking multiple sections or refreshing the page _(evidence: TSSD-3939)_
- Unable to modify or delete auto-created annual leave deductions — Cause: System-level restriction on editing automatically generated payroll deductions — Workaround: Escalate to development team for manual intervention or system modification _(evidence: TSSD-3946)_
- System cannot automatically handle EOS calculation for mid-month leavers with unpaid leave — Cause: Rigid backend calculation logic does not account for partial month employment or unpaid leave — Workaround: Manually adjust departure date and perform calculations outside the system, or make manual adjustments to EOS settlement _(evidence: TSSD-4033)_
- Confusion about how to calculate prorated salary for mid-month joining employees — Cause: Proration calculation requires dividing (Basic salary + allowances) by total working days in month, then multiplying by actual working days in employment period — Workaround: Manually calculate: (Basic + Allowances) / total working days in cycle * included working days in employment period _(evidence: TSSD-4129)_
- Perceived incorrect salary proration — Cause: Misunderstanding of how working days are calculated based on work week configuration — Workaround: Verify work week configuration and understand that all days marked as working will be used in proration calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- Confusion about how working days are counted for salary proration — Cause: System automatically excludes weekends and calculates working days in the month — Workaround: Verify total working days by subtracting weekends from total calendar days in the month _(evidence: TSSD-4303)_
- Deduction amount differs from expected monthly salary — Cause: Daily wage calculated as 4300/30.42 = 141.35, then multiplied by days in leave period — Workaround: Verify unpaid leave policy settings and understand the 30.42 days divisor method _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- Inconsistent salary deduction due to public holiday changes — Cause: Timing mismatch between Time Off and Payroll module calculations — Workaround: Manually add deduction to correct the calculated amount _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Discrepancy between expected and calculated leave salary — Cause: Calculation follows policy configuration, not calendar reality. Daily rate is divided based on predefined policy settings — Workaround: Verify daily rate configuration in leave policy and understand the system's divisor setting _(evidence: TSSD-4731)_
- Differences between system and manual gratuity calculations — Cause: Calculation involves complex service duration split and tiered daily rates (21 days/year for first 5 years, 30 days/year after) — Workaround: Manually verify calculation using daily wage (13,800/30 = 460), apply tiered rates, and prorate partial years by days _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Limited flexibility in leave accrual for mid-month departures — Cause: System defaults to monthly accrual policy — Workaround: Configure conditional accrual policy for daily leave earning or manually adjust EOS balance _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Incorrect gratuity amount for limited contract employees — Cause: Calculation logic fails to consistently apply expected formula — Workaround: 1. Manually update the amount
2. Change departure reason to 'End of contract' or 'Termination' to trigger correct calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4796)_
- Inability to automatically prorate salaries for different employee groups — Cause: Lack of configurable proration calculation methods in the payroll system — Workaround: Manually adjust salaries for employee groups with unique proration requirements _(evidence: TSSD-4882)_
- Unable to edit leave policy calculation method — Cause: Overwrite option in Payroll Configuration is enabled, preventing changes in Leave Policy — Workaround: Disable the 'Overwrite' option in Payroll Configuration → Daily Wage → Unpaid Leave Deduction before attempting to modify leave policy settings _(evidence: TSSD-4947)_
