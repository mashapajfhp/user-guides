# daily_wage_calculator

**Module area:** Payroll  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** jira  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-22  

## Feature Overview

Operationally, "daily_wage_calculator" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors.

## Operational Reality

### Known Issues

- **Daily Wage Formula Discrepancy**: The daily wage calculator in payroll settings overrides the leave policy formula for unpaid leave. The system displays a greyed-out formula in the leave policy, indicating that the payroll configuration takes precedence. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were incorrectly based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in payroll calculation discrepancies. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **End of Service Gratuity Calculation Incorrect for Leap Years**: The End of Service (EOS) gratuity calculator incorrectly handles leap years by defaulting to 365 days instead of 366 days for 2024, resulting in an inaccurate total service period and gratuity amount calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **End of Service Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Error**: End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Gratuity Calculation Complexity**: The daily wage calculator's gratuity calculation involves complex logic for handling service periods, particularly for partial years and leap year adjustments. The system calculates service duration differently than manual expectations, using specific methodologies for segmenting service periods and applying different daily rates based on years of service. _(evidence: TSSD-4742, TSSD-2252)_
- **Gratuity Amount Discrepancy in Leap Year**: System may not consistently handle February 29th in leap year calculations for service duration, causing minor differences in gratuity computation. The system calculated 912 days vs. client's manual calculation of 913 days, resulting in a slight gratuity amount variation (AED 14,691.95 vs. AED 14,708.05). _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Incorrect Days Calculation in Gratuity Computation**: System calculates one extra day in total job tenure (622 vs 623 days), which impacts gratuity calculation precision. The platform seems to add an extra day when computing working days and years of service. _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Leave Salary Accrual Calculation Varies by Monthly Working Days**: The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. The daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals. _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Inconsistent Daily Wage Calculation Divisors**: The system uses different divisors for leave salary and salary proration calculations. Leave salary uses a 30-day divisor, while salary proration uses a 30.42-day divisor, causing calculation mismatches. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Misinterpretation of Working Days Calculation**: User initially misunderstood that the system calculates salary proration based on the specific work week configuration. In this case, the NVK Operations work week had all 7 days configured as working days, resulting in a full 31-day working month calculation. _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees**: The system fails to correctly prorate salaries when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing. When payroll is processed earlier than the departure date, the full monthly salary is displayed instead of a prorated amount. _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Duplicate Payroll Deductions After Leave Recalculation**: When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Moving the leave request back to pending/accepted does not resolve the issue. Even after deleting the unpaid leave request entirely, the unpaid leave deduction persists in payroll deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Inconsistency**: When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, there is a timing mismatch between the Time Off and Payroll modules, causing incorrect daily wage calculations and salary deductions. _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Daily Wage Calculation Using Non-Standard Divisor**: The system calculates unpaid leave deductions using a custom daily wage divisor (30.42 days) instead of calendar days, which can produce deduction amounts that differ from user expectations _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Incorrect Days Display in February Remarks**: The system displays incorrect remarks for daily wage calculations in February, showing 31 days instead of the actual 29 days for leap years. The backend calculation remains mathematically correct, but the frontend display creates potential user confusion. _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation**: Global daily rate configuration overrides policy-specific leave calculation methods, potentially causing incorrect salary deductions. The system uses a global daily rate that takes precedence over individual policy settings, calculating deductions using a method different from the configured leave policy. _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Unpaid Leave Daily Rate Incorrectly Displayed**: The system displays the daily rate from the payroll processing month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate does not match the month of leave. _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Limitations

- **Lack of Automated Salary Calculation**: The current Bayzat payroll system lacks automated salary calculation based on precise working days. The platform cannot dynamically adjust salaries proportionally when employees work more or fewer than the standard 26 working days. _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- **Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy**: Payroll daily wage calculator configuration takes precedence over leave policy formula for unpaid leave calculations. _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- **Salary Config Change Impact on Leave Deductions**: Unpaid leave deductions depend on salary configuration timing. If a new salary configuration is created after a leave request, the system may not automatically update the deduction amount. _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- **Incorrect Handling of 366-Day Years**: The system uses a fixed 365-day year calculation, failing to recognize leap years like 2024 with 366 days _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- **Decimal Precision in Pro-Rated Calculations**: Pro-rated amount calculations consistently show amounts less than expected by small decimal points (0.1 or 0.2) _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- **Monthly Leave Accrual Limitation**: Monthly accrual policies only grant leave days at month-end, preventing prorated accrual for mid-month departures _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- **Ambiguous Day Counting Methodology**: Unclear rules for counting service days, including whether departure date is considered a working day and how leap year days are incorporated _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- **Nuanced Service Period Calculation**: Service periods are calculated with specific rules: first 5 years at 21 days per year, subsequent years at 30 days per year, with special handling for incomplete years using day-based prorating and leap year adjustments. _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- **Fixed Daily Wage Divisor Limitation**: Daily wage is calculated using a hardcoded divisor of 30 days (Basic/30), which cannot be modified or configured to alternative formulas _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- **Monthly Working Days Impact on Leave Salary Calculation**: Leave encashment calculations use working days as the denominator, causing monthly variations in daily wage rates _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- **Separate Daily Wage Calculation Methods**: The platform calculates leave salary and salary proration using independent daily wage configurations with different divisors. _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- **Proration Calculation Based on Work Week Configuration**: Salary proration is calculated based on the specific work week configuration, which may include all 7 days as working days _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- **Limited Proration Calculation Logic**: Salary proration only works correctly for departure dates in the past, not for future departure dates _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- **Inconsistent Deduction Handling During Leave Transactions**: The system cannot automatically reconcile leave transactions and payroll deductions when modifications or deletions occur. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- **Inflexible Daily Wage Calculation Method**: Daily wage is calculated as (basic salary + allowance) / working days, where working days exclude weekends and public holidays specific to the employee's country of residence _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- **Fixed 30.42 Days Divisor for Wage Calculations**: System uses a fixed 30.42 days divisor for daily wage calculations, which may not align with exact calendar days _(evidence: TSSD-4368)_
- **Leap Year Day Calculation for Unpaid Leave**: Daily wage calculations for unpaid leave must use the actual number of calendar days in a month, with specific attention to February in leap years (29 days, not 31 days). _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- **Global Settings Override Policy Configurations**: The platform has a global configuration that supersedes individual policy-level settings for unpaid leave calculations _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
- **Daily Rate Calculation Method**: Daily rate calculated as (Basic + Allowances) / Working Days, excluding public holidays _(evidence: TSSD-1807)_

### Edge Cases

- Employee service spanning a leap year (2024) — Incorrect calculation of total service days and gratuity amount _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- Employee departure during incomplete month — Leave balance and gratuity calculation may not fully reflect partial month's service _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Handling of February 29th in service duration calculation — Potential minor calculation discrepancies in gratuity amount _(evidence: TSSD-1625)_
- Handling of partial years during leap years — Potential calculation differences due to 366-day divisor vs 365-day divisor _(evidence: TSSD-2252)_
- Handling different contract types and departure scenarios — Potential miscalculation of end-of-service benefits due to rigid calculation method _(evidence: TSSD-2043)_
- Payroll processed before employee departure date — Potential full salary display instead of prorated amount _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Recalculating unpaid leave after initial transaction submission — System creates duplicate payroll deductions with conflicting calculations _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Late addition of public holidays after leave request processing — Misalignment between Time Off and Payroll module calculations, leading to incorrect salary deductions _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- February Leap Year Daily Rate Calculation — Potential miscalculation if using incorrect number of days (31 instead of 29) _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_

### Troubleshooting Notes

- Unable to automatically calculate salary based on working days — Cause: Current system lacks automated prorating mechanism — Workaround: Use a mix of unpaid leaves and overtime tracked separately for each employee _(evidence: TSSD-4905)_
- Different daily wage formulas in leave policy and payroll settings — Cause: Payroll settings use basic + allowances, while leave policy initially shows basic only. Payroll configuration intentionally overrides leave policy for unpaid leave. — Workaround: Verify daily wage calculator configuration in payroll settings first; understand that this will override leave policy formula _(evidence: TSSD-2648)_
- Incorrect unpaid leave deduction amount — Cause: Deduction calculated based on outdated salary configuration — Workaround: Delete the existing leave request and recreate it if the deduction has not been processed yet _(evidence: TSSD-1581)_
- Gratuity amount differs from expected calculation — Cause: System uses 365-day year instead of 366 days for leap years — Workaround: Manually adjust calculation to include 366 days for leap years _(evidence: TSSD-4179)_
- End of Service amounts show incorrect decimal precision — Cause: Systematic rounding error in daily wage formula application — Workaround: Ticket was escalated to development team and resolved _(evidence: TSSD-2605)_
- Incomplete leave balance for mid-month departures — Cause: Monthly accrual policy restricts automatic prorating of leave days — Workaround: Manually adjust EOS balance in the system or switch to conditional accrual policy for daily leave earning _(evidence: TSSD-4742)_
- Gratuity Calculation Verification _(evidence: TSSD-1625, TSSD-2252, TSSD-2043)_
- Inconsistent leave salary accrual calculations across months — Cause: Daily wage calculator set to 'working days' method in leave encashment settings — Workaround: Switch to 'custom days' setting for more consistent leave salary accrual calculations _(evidence: TSSD-3648)_
- Salary proration calculation differs from expected formula — Cause: Different daily wage divisors used for leave salary (30 days) and salary proration (30.42 days) — Workaround: Manually align daily wage configurations or use consistent divisor across calculations _(evidence: TSSD-2321)_
- Perceived incorrect salary proration calculation — Cause: System calculates proration based on work week configuration, which may include all days as working days — Workaround: Verify employee's work week configuration to understand proration calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4292)_
- Full monthly salary displayed for offboarded employees — Cause: Calculation logic does not account for departure date relative to payroll processing date — Workaround: Manually adjust salary calculation or wait for system fix _(evidence: TSSD-3058)_
- Persistent payroll deductions remain after leave request deletion — Cause: Lack of synchronization between leave management and payroll deduction systems — Workaround: Manual removal of orphaned deductions may be required. Contact system administrator for backend cleanup. _(evidence: TSSD-2532)_
- Incorrect salary deduction due to public holiday timing mismatch — Cause: Timing difference between public holiday addition and leave request processing — Workaround: Manually add deduction to correct the calculated amount, though not recommended by customers _(evidence: TSSD-4464)_
- Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation _(evidence: TSSD-4368, TSSD-1807)_
- Remarks show incorrect daily rate for February — Cause: System defaulting to 31-day month instead of using actual calendar days — Workaround: Verify actual deduction amount by calculating daily rate using correct number of calendar days (29 for February in leap year) _(evidence: TSSD-1301)_
- Unpaid leave deductions calculated using gross salary instead of basic salary — Cause: Global daily rate configuration overrides policy-specific calculation settings — Workaround: Verify global unpaid leave daily rate configuration before investigating policy-level discrepancies _(evidence: TSSD-1753)_
