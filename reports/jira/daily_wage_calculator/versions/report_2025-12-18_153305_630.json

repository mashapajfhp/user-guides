    "description": "Operationally, \"daily wage calculator\" is used to compute daily-rate based salary amounts (e.g., deductions, proration, or settlement-related calculations) based on configuration and payroll/leave context. Ticket evidence repeatedly connects this behaviour to unpaid leave deductions and leave-related payroll adjustments. Evidence indicates calculations may use either calendar days or working days (with weekends/holidays considerations) depending on configuration and scenario. Tickets highlight configuration precedence where global payroll settings can override policy-level settings, creating unexpected outcomes for users. Tickets also report UI/display mismatches (e.g., remarks showing different day counts) even when backend calculations are otherwise consistent. Several tickets suggest recalculation/synchronization gaps where changes (salary config, holidays, deleted requests) do not retroactively update already-generated results. Customer requests frequently ask for greater configurability, clearer transparency, and control over calculation bases and divisors."
