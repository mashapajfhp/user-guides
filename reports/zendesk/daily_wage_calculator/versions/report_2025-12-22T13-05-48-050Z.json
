    "description": "The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate and automatically deduct pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to salary reduction by dividing an employee's total monthly salary (basic + allowances) by the actual number of working days in a given month. The calculator supports two leave policy approaches: calendar days (30-day basis) or working days (typically 22 days), with a critical capability to subtract public holidays from the working days calculation. This ensures accurate and fair salary adjustments that reflect an employee's actual time worked, supporting HR personnel in managing complex payroll deductions with precision and transparency. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll management tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the tool enables payroll managers to adapt wage calculations to specific organizational policies and labor regulations. The calculator allows granular control over salary components, permitting users to factor in basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances exclusively. This sophisticated system addresses critical payroll scenarios such as salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, ensuring accurate and compliant compensation processing. The tool is particularly valuable for companies in regions like UAE and KSA, where labor laws mandate specific wage calculation methodologies. By providing customizable calculation frameworks, the Daily Wage Calculator helps organizations streamline payroll processes, reduce manual computation errors, and maintain transparency in employee compensation. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. This sophisticated system allows precise salary calculations for partial pay periods, specifically impacting an employee's first salary and end-of-service settlement. By providing flexible calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days, the tool offers granular control over salary proration. The feature supports accurate compensation management by allowing administrators to dynamically adjust salary calculations to reflect the exact duration and type of work performed. It integrates directly with the payroll system, ensuring that all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table are automatically updated when proration settings are modified. The tool is designed to handle complex salary scenarios, giving organizations the ability to maintain financial precision and fairness in employee compensation."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – Daily Wage Calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-22\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate and automatically deduct pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to salary reduction by dividing an employee's total monthly salary (basic + allowances) by the actual number of working days in a given month. The calculator supports two leave policy approaches: calendar days (30-day basis) or working days (typically 22 days), with a critical capability to subtract public holidays from the working days calculation. This ensures accurate and fair salary adjustments that reflect an employee's actual time worked, supporting HR personnel in managing complex payroll deductions with precision and transparency. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll management tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the tool enables payroll managers to adapt wage calculations to specific organizational policies and labor regulations. The calculator allows granular control over salary components, permitting users to factor in basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances exclusively. This sophisticated system addresses critical payroll scenarios such as salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, ensuring accurate and compliant compensation processing. The tool is particularly valuable for companies in regions like UAE and KSA, where labor laws mandate specific wage calculation methodologies. By providing customizable calculation frameworks, the Daily Wage Calculator helps organizations streamline payroll processes, reduce manual computation errors, and maintain transparency in employee compensation. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. This sophisticated system allows precise salary calculations for partial pay periods, specifically impacting an employee's first salary and end-of-service settlement. By providing flexible calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days, the tool offers granular control over salary proration. The feature supports accurate compensation management by allowing administrators to dynamically adjust salary calculations to reflect the exact duration and type of work performed. It integrates directly with the payroll system, ensuring that all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table are automatically updated when proration settings are modified. The tool is designed to handle complex salary scenarios, giving organizations the ability to maintain financial precision and fairness in employee compensation.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n-
