    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate and deduct employee compensation for unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining salary reductions by dividing an employee's total monthly salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a given month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing organizations to use either calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the basis for calculations. A key sophistication of this tool is its ability to automatically account for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate pay deductions. This feature streamlines HR processes by automating complex salary calculations, reducing manual intervention, and ensuring consistent and fair application of unpaid leave financial adjustments across the organization. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation on a daily basis. By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the system enables payroll managers to adapt wage calculations to specific organizational needs and labor regulations. The calculator allows selection of different salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, creating a highly customizable approach to wage computation. This tool specifically addresses critical payroll scenarios like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, giving companies greater control and accuracy in financial processing. The flexibility extends to handling variations in monthly day counts and accommodating company-specific holiday calendars. By supporting different calculation methodologies, the tool helps ensure compliance with local labor laws, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA where specific wage calculation standards exist. The daily wage calculator transforms traditional, rigid wage calculation methods into a dynamic, configurable system that meets diverse organizational payroll requirements. The daily wage calculator is a payroll management tool designed to proportionally adjust employee compensation based on actual days worked. It enables super administrators to precisely calculate salaries by selecting different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. This feature is critical for handling prorated salaries during an employee's first or last month of employment, ensuring accurate compensation calculations. By providing flexible calculation methods, organizations can adapt salary computations to their specific business rules and employment scenarios. The tool integrates directly with the payroll system, allowing administrators to make real-time adjustments that impact active (unpaid) payroll transactions. Its primary purpose is to simplify complex salary prorations, reducing manual calculation errors and providing transparency in compensation management. The daily wage calculator supports fair and precise salary adjustments for partial work periods, benefiting both employers and employees."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-21\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate and deduct employee compensation for unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining salary reductions by dividing an employee's total monthly salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a given month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing organizations to use either calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the basis for calculations. A key sophistication of this tool is its ability to automatically account for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate pay deductions. This feature streamlines HR processes by automating complex salary calculations, reducing manual intervention, and ensuring consistent and fair application of unpaid leave financial adjustments across the organization. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation on a daily basis. By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the system enables payroll managers to adapt wage calculations to specific organizational needs and labor regulations. The calculator allows selection of different salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, creating a highly customizable approach to wage computation. This tool specifically addresses critical payroll scenarios like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, giving companies greater control and accuracy in financial processing. The flexibility extends to handling variations in monthly day counts and accommodating company-specific holiday calendars. By supporting different calculation methodologies, the tool helps ensure compliance with local labor laws, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA where specific wage calculation standards exist. The daily wage calculator transforms traditional, rigid wage calculation methods into a dynamic, configurable system that meets diverse organizational payroll requirements. The daily wage calculator is a payroll management tool designed to proportionally adjust employee compensation based on actual days worked. It enables super administrators to precisely calculate salaries by selecting different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. This feature is critical for handling prorated salaries during an employee's first or last month of employment, ensuring accurate compensation calculations. By providing flexible calculation methods, organizations can adapt salary computations to their specific business rules and employment scenarios. The tool integrates directly with the payroll system, allowing administrators to make real-time adjustments that impact active (unpaid) payroll transactions. Its primary purpose is to simplify complex salary prorations, reducing manual calculation errors and providing transparency in compensation management. The daily wage calculator supports fair and precise salary adjustments for partial work periods, benefiting both employers and employees.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily
