    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system functionality designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining pay reductions by dividing an employee's total monthly salary by the actual number of working days, accounting for variations in leave policies and public holidays. The system automatically generates pay deductions upon approved unpaid leave requests, ensuring accurate and transparent salary adjustments. By supporting both calendar day and working day leave policies, the calculator offers flexibility for different organizational payroll approaches. The feature helps HR personnel and payroll administrators manage leave-related financial calculations with precision, reducing manual computational errors and streamlining payroll processing. It considers nuanced factors like public holidays and specific leave policy parameters when computing daily wage deductions. This automated calculation method ensures fair and consistent salary adjustments across the organization. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation on a daily basis. It addresses complex wage calculation scenarios by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The tool enables payroll managers to customize wage calculations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. By supporting salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, the calculator helps companies maintain accurate and compliant payroll processes. Its adaptability allows organizations to align calculations with local labor laws, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA where specific day-counting conventions are prevalent. The calculator eliminates previous limitations in daily rate determination, providing greater control and transparency in wage computations. Designed for superadmins, payroll table managers, and transaction processors, this feature streamlines complex payroll calculations while accommodating diverse organizational policies. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool designed to help organizations proportionally calculate employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides super administrators with flexible methods to prorate salaries using different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. This feature is crucial for accurately adjusting compensation during an employee's first month of work or final settlement, ensuring precise and fair salary calculations. By allowing granular control over salary proration, the tool helps organizations maintain accurate payroll records and adapt to various employment scenarios. The calculator integrates directly with the payroll system, enabling administrators to make real-time adjustments that immediately impact active payroll transactions. Its primary purpose is to simplify complex salary calculations and provide transparency in compensation management."
