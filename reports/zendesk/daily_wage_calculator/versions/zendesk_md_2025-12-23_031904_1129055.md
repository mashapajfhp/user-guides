## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing organizations to use either calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) for calculations. A key sophistication of this tool is its ability to automatically account for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate pay deduction. This feature streamlines the complex process of managing unpaid leave, reducing manual calculation errors and providing a transparent method for proportional salary reduction. By integrating directly with payroll systems, it ensures seamless and precise financial adjustments when employees take time off without pay. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses historical limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The calculator enables payroll managers to customize wage computations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. This solution supports critical payroll processes like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By accommodating different regional labor law requirements, such as the 30-day month standard in UAE and KSA, the tool provides granular control over wage calculations. The system allows for nuanced configurations that account for variations like public holidays and weekend exclusions. Organizations can now implement more accurate and policy-aligned compensation calculations with enhanced flexibility and precision. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool designed to help organizations proportionally calculate employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides super administrators with flexible options to prorate salaries using different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. This feature is critical for accurately adjusting compensation during an employee's first month of work or final settlement, ensuring precise and fair salary calculations. By allowing granular control over salary proration, the tool helps organizations maintain accurate payroll records and adapt to various employment scenarios. The calculator integrates directly with the payroll system, enabling administrators to make real-time adjustments that immediately impact active payroll transactions. Its primary value lies in providing transparency, flexibility, and precision in salary calculations across different employment contexts.
