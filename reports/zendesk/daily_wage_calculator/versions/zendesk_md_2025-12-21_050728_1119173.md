## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll management tool designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, supporting both calendar day (30 days) and working day (e.g., 22 days) calculations. A key feature is its ability to automatically account for public holidays, subtracting them from the total working days to ensure accurate salary reduction. This tool streamlines the unpaid leave process by automatically generating pay deductions and reflecting them in the payroll table. By providing a transparent and consistent method for calculating daily wages, the system helps HR personnel and payroll administrators manage employee compensation with precision and fairness. The calculator ensures that salary deductions are calculated based on a clear, predefined methodology that considers actual working days and official holidays. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It enables payroll managers to dynamically compute daily wage rates using multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The calculator addresses complex payroll scenarios by allowing users to select specific salary components for calculations, such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. By supporting different calculation methodologies, the tool helps companies accurately handle salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. The system accommodates regional variations, such as the common practice in UAE and KSA of using 30 custom days to align with local labor laws. This flexibility ensures that organizations can implement payroll calculations that match their specific business policies and regulatory requirements. The calculator provides granular control over wage computations, reducing manual effort and potential errors in salary processing. The daily wage calculator is a payroll management tool designed to help organizations proportionally adjust employee compensation based on actual days worked. It enables super administrators to precisely calculate prorated salaries by selecting different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. This feature is crucial for accurately determining an employee's first salary and end-of-service settlement, ensuring fair and precise compensation. By providing flexible calculation methods, the tool supports complex payroll scenarios where standard monthly salary calculations may not suffice. The calculator allows administrators to make granular adjustments that reflect the exact working period, maintaining payroll accuracy and transparency. It integrates directly with the payroll system, automatically updating active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. The tool is particularly valuable for handling partial month employment, variable work arrangements, and ensuring employees are compensated precisely for their actual work time.
