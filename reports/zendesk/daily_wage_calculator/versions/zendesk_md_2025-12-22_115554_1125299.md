## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system functionality designed to precisely calculate and deduct employee compensation for unpaid leave periods. It provides a systematic approach for HR and payroll administrators to determine salary reductions by dividing an employee's total monthly salary by the actual number of working days. The calculator supports flexible leave policies, accommodating both calendar day and working day calculations while intelligently accounting for public holidays. By automatically generating pay deductions upon leave approval, the system ensures accurate and transparent salary adjustments. This feature helps organizations maintain consistent and fair compensation practices, reducing manual calculation errors and streamlining payroll processing. The calculation methodology allows for nuanced handling of leave scenarios, considering factors like total salary components and actual workdays in a given month. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses historical limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple computation approaches, including calendar days, working days, and custom day configurations. The calculator enables payroll managers to customize wage calculations based on specific organizational policies and labor law requirements. Users can select different salary components for calculation, such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. This solution supports critical payroll processes like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By providing granular control over wage computation, the tool helps companies accurately compensate employees while maintaining compliance with regional labor regulations. The flexibility of the calculator accommodates diverse business needs, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA where specific wage calculation standards are prevalent. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to precisely prorate employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides flexibility in calculating compensation by allowing selection between different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. This feature is critical for accurately adjusting an employee's first salary and end-of-service settlement, ensuring fair and proportional compensation. By offering multiple calculation methods, organizations can align salary calculations with their specific payroll policies and work arrangements. The tool integrates directly with the payroll system, allowing immediate updates that affect active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. Super administrators can make granular adjustments to salary calculations, providing a sophisticated approach to handling partial month employments or variable work periods. The system also includes safeguards to prevent unintended changes by requiring manual rejection and resaving of existing prorated salary transactions when modifications are made.
