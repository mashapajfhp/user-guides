    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system functionality designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, supporting both calendar day (30 days) and working day (e.g., 22 days) calculations. It intelligently accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the total working days, ensuring accurate and fair salary adjustments. This feature automates the complex process of leave-related payroll deductions, reducing manual calculation errors and streamlining HR administrative tasks. By offering a transparent and consistent method of calculating daily wages, the system helps maintain clear financial communication between employers and employees during unpaid leave periods. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses historical limitations in salary calculations by offering multiple calculation bases, including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The solution enables payroll managers to customize wage computations according to specific organizational needs and labor law requirements. By supporting different salary component selections like basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, the tool provides granular control over wage calculations. The calculator specifically impacts three critical payroll areas: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. Its flexibility allows companies, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA, to align wage calculations with local labor regulations. The tool empowers payroll professionals to handle complex compensation scenarios with greater accuracy and transparency. The Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) is a sophisticated payroll management tool designed to help organizations precisely prorate employee salaries based on actual days worked. It enables super administrators to flexibly calculate compensation by selecting different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. This feature is critical for accurately adjusting an employee's first salary and end-of-service settlement, ensuring fair and proportional compensation. By providing granular control over salary calculations, the tool helps organizations maintain payroll accuracy and transparency. The system allows administrators to make real-time adjustments to salary proration settings, with immediate effects on active payroll transactions. Its flexibility supports diverse organizational payroll needs by accommodating various methods of calculating daily wage. The tool is particularly useful during partial employment periods, such as when an employee joins mid-month or leaves before a full pay cycle."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-20\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system functionality designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, supporting both calendar day (30 days) and working day (e.g., 22 days) calculations.
