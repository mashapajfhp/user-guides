    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system functionality designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, supporting both calendar day (30 days) and working day (e.g., 22 days) calculations. It intelligently accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the total working days, ensuring accurate and fair salary adjustments. This feature automates the complex process of leave-related payroll deductions, reducing manual calculation errors and providing HR personnel with a standardized method for handling unpaid leave financial implications. By integrating seamlessly with payroll systems, the daily wage calculator streamlines administrative processes and maintains precise employee compensation records. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It enables payroll managers to determine daily wage rates through multiple calculation bases, including calendar days, working days, and custom days. This feature addresses complex salary computation scenarios such as salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By offering granular control over calculation parameters, the tool allows companies to align wage calculations with specific organizational policies and labor regulations. Users can select different salary components for calculations, such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. The calculator supports customization to accommodate varied business requirements, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA where specific labor law considerations exist. Its primary value lies in providing transparency, accuracy, and adaptability in wage computation processes. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to precisely prorate employee salaries based on actual days worked. This sophisticated feature allows organizations to calculate compensation proportionally by selecting from multiple calculation bases including custom days, calendar days, or working days. By providing flexible salary adjustment mechanisms, the tool ensures accurate compensation for employees during their first salary period or end-of-service settlements. The calculator integrates directly with the payroll system, allowing administrators to make real-time adjustments that immediately impact active payroll transactions. Its primary purpose is to provide granular control over salary calculations, accommodating various employment scenarios such as partial month work periods, mid-month hiring, or terminations. The tool helps organizations maintain payroll accuracy, transparency, and fairness by enabling precise pro-rata salary computations."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-18\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system functionality designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, supporting both calendar day (30 days) and working day (e.g., 22 days) calculations. It intelligently accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the total working days, ensuring accurate and fair salary adjustments. This feature automates the complex process of leave-related payroll deductions, reducing manual calculation errors and providing HR personnel with a standardized method for handling unpaid leave financial implications. By integrating seamlessly with payroll systems, the daily wage calculator streamlines administrative processes and maintains precise employee compensation records. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It enables payroll managers to determine daily wage rates through multiple calculation bases, including calendar days, working days, and custom days. This feature addresses complex salary computation scenarios such as salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By offering granular control over calculation parameters, the tool allows companies to align wage calculations with specific organizational policies and labor regulations. Users can select different salary components for calculations, such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. The calculator supports customization to accommodate varied business requirements, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA where specific labor law considerations exist. Its primary value lies in providing transparency, accuracy, and adaptability in wage computation processes. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to precisely prorate employee salaries based on actual days worked. This sophisticated feature allows organizations to calculate compensation proportionally by selecting from multiple calculation bases including custom days, calendar days, or working days. By providing flexible salary adjustment mechanisms, the tool ensures accurate compensation for employees during their first salary period or end-of-service settlements. The calculator integrates directly with the payroll system, allowing administrators to make real-time adjustments that immediately impact active payroll transactions. Its primary purpose is to provide granular control over salary calculations, accommodating various employment scenarios such as partial month work periods, mid-month hiring, or terminations. The tool helps organizations maintain payroll accuracy, transparency, and fairness by enabling precise pro-rata salary computations.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay
