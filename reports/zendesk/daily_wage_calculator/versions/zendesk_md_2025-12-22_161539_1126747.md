## Feature Overview

The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator supports two primary leave policy approaches: calendar days (30-day basis) or working days (typically 22 days), with the critical capability of automatically adjusting for public holidays. By dynamically subtracting holidays from working days, the system ensures accurate and fair salary calculations. This feature streamlines HR processes by automating complex payroll adjustments, reducing manual calculation errors, and providing a transparent method for handling unpaid leave salary deductions. The tool is particularly valuable for HR personnel and payroll administrators who need to manage employee compensation precisely and efficiently. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses historical limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The calculator enables payroll managers to customize wage computations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. This solution supports critical payroll processes like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, ensuring accurate and compliant compensation calculations. By accommodating different regional labor law requirements, such as the 30-day month standard in UAE and KSA, the tool provides significant flexibility for diverse organizational needs. The calculator eliminates manual calculation complexities, reducing potential errors and standardizing wage computation across an organization. Its configurable nature allows companies to align wage calculations with their specific internal policies and legal requirements, making it a powerful tool for precise financial management. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to precisely prorate employee salaries based on actual days worked. This feature provides flexibility in salary calculations by allowing selection between different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. It critically supports accurate compensation for employees during their first month of employment or final service settlement, ensuring proportional salary adjustments. The system allows administrators to make granular changes to salary calculation methods, which automatically update all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. By offering multiple calculation methodologies, the tool supports diverse organizational payroll requirements and ensures fair, precise compensation tracking. The feature is designed to provide administrative flexibility while maintaining systematic control over salary prorations. It requires careful management, particularly during open payroll months, where existing transactions may need manual rejection and resetting.
