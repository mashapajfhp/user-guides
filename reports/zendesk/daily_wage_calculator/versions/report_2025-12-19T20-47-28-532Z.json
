    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic method for determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, supporting both calendar day (30 days) and working day (e.g., 22 days) calculations. It intelligently accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the total working days, ensuring accurate and fair salary reductions. This automated tool helps HR personnel and payroll administrators manage leave-related financial adjustments efficiently, reducing manual calculation errors and streamlining payroll processes. By integrating with leave management and payroll systems, the feature creates automatic deductions that are directly reflected in the employee's payroll table. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses historical limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The tool enables payroll managers to customize wage calculations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. This flexibility allows companies to align their wage calculations with specific labor laws and internal policies, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA. The calculator impacts critical payroll processes including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By supporting different calculation methodologies, the tool provides greater accuracy and transparency in wage computation. Organizations can now handle complex wage calculations with more control and precision, reducing manual computational errors and ensuring compliance with local labor regulations. The Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. This sophisticated feature allows organizations to precisely calculate compensation for partial pay periods, addressing scenarios like first-month employment, mid-month hiring, or end-of-service settlements. By providing flexible calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, and working days, the tool ensures accurate and fair salary prorations. The system integrates directly with the payroll table, automatically applying changes to active (unpaid) salary amounts. Super administrators can fine-tune salary calculations with granular control, ensuring employees receive exactly the right compensation for their worked period. The tool supports dynamic payroll adjustments while maintaining compliance and transparency in salary processing."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-19\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic method for determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, supporting both calendar day (30 days) and working day (e.g., 22 days) calculations. It intelligently accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the total working days, ensuring accurate and fair salary reductions. This automated tool helps HR personnel and payroll administrators manage leave-related financial adjustments efficiently, reducing manual calculation errors and streamlining payroll processes. By integrating with leave management and payroll systems, the feature creates automatic deductions that are directly reflected in the employee's payroll table. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses historical limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The tool enables payroll managers to customize wage calculations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. This flexibility allows companies to align their wage calculations with specific labor laws and internal policies, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA. The calculator impacts critical payroll processes including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By supporting different calculation methodologies, the tool provides greater accuracy and transparency in wage computation. Organizations can now handle complex wage calculations with more control and precision, reducing manual computational errors and ensuring compliance with local labor regulations. The Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. This sophisticated feature allows organizations to precisely calculate compensation for partial pay periods, addressing scenarios like first-month employment, mid-month hiring, or end-of-service settlements. By providing flexible calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, and working days, the tool ensures accurate and fair salary prorations. The system integrates directly with the payroll table, automatically applying changes to active (unpaid) salary amounts. Super administrators can fine-tune salary calculations with granular control, ensuring employees receive exactly the right compensation for their worked period. The tool supports dynamic payroll adjustments while maintaining compliance and transparency in salary processing.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking
