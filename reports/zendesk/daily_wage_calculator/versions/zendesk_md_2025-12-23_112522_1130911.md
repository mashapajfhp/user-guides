## Feature Overview

The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing organizations to choose between calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) for calculations. A key sophistication of this tool is its ability to automatically account for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate salary reduction. This feature streamlines the complex process of managing unpaid leave by automating pay deductions, reducing manual calculation errors, and providing a transparent method for adjusting employee compensation based on time away from work. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation across various scenarios. It enables payroll managers to dynamically compute daily wage rates using multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, or custom days. The system allows granular control over salary component selection, supporting calculations for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By accommodating different regional labor law requirements, such as the 30-day month standard in UAE and KSA, the calculator offers configurable options that align with diverse organizational payroll policies. Users can customize calculations by excluding weekends and public holidays, selecting specific salary components like basic salary or allowances, and tailoring the computational approach to their specific business needs. This flexibility helps organizations achieve more accurate and compliant wage calculations while reducing manual computational errors. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management feature that enables super administrators to precisely prorate employee salaries based on actual days worked. This sophisticated tool allows organizations to calculate compensation proportionally by selecting from multiple calculation bases including custom days, calendar days, or working days. By providing flexible salary calculation methods, the feature ensures accurate compensation for employees during their first month of employment or final service settlement. The system allows administrators to make granular adjustments to salary calculations, which automatically update active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. This functionality is critical for maintaining payroll accuracy, especially during partial employment periods or when standard monthly salary calculations are insufficient. The tool provides administrators with the ability to reject and resave prorated salary transactions when necessary, offering comprehensive control over compensation calculations.
