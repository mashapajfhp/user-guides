    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic method for determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing calculations based on either calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). A critical aspect of the calculation is the consideration of public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate salary reduction. This automated tool helps HR personnel and payroll administrators manage leave-related financial adjustments with precision and consistency, reducing manual calculation errors and standardizing unpaid leave salary deductions across the organization. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation on a daily basis. By offering multiple calculation bases like calendar days, working days, and custom days, the tool enables precise salary prorations, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. Companies can customize their wage calculations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. The calculator addresses previous limitations in daily rate computations by introducing granular control over wage calculations. It supports diverse organizational needs, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA where labor laws have specific monthly wage computation requirements. The tool is strategically positioned within the payroll settings, making it accessible to payroll administrators and transaction processors. By providing configurable calculation methods, the daily wage calculator helps organizations maintain accurate and compliant compensation practices. The Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to precisely prorate employee salaries based on actual days worked. This feature provides flexibility in calculating compensation by allowing selection between different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. It directly impacts an employee's first salary and end-of-service settlement, ensuring accurate and proportional compensation. The calculator allows organizations to adapt salary calculations to their specific operational requirements, accommodating variations in work periods and employment start/end dates. By providing granular control over salary proration, the tool helps maintain payroll accuracy and transparency. Super administrators can make real-time adjustments to proration settings, with changes immediately affecting active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. The system also includes safeguards to prevent unintended modifications by requiring manual rejection and resaving of existing prorated salary transactions when changes are made during an open payroll month."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-21\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic method for determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing calculations based on either calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). A critical aspect of the calculation is the consideration of public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate salary reduction. This automated tool helps HR personnel and payroll administrators manage leave-related financial adjustments with precision and consistency, reducing manual calculation errors and standardizing unpaid leave salary deductions across the organization. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation on a daily basis. By offering multiple calculation bases like calendar days, working days, and custom days, the tool enables precise salary prorations, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. Companies can customize their wage calculations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. The calculator addresses previous limitations in daily rate computations by introducing granular control over wage calculations. It supports diverse organizational needs, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA where labor laws have specific monthly wage computation requirements. The tool is strategically positioned within the payroll settings, making it accessible to payroll administrators and transaction processors. By providing configurable calculation methods, the daily wage calculator helps organizations maintain accurate and compliant compensation practices. The Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to precisely prorate employee salaries based on actual days worked. This feature provides flexibility in calculating compensation by allowing selection between different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. It directly impacts an employee's first salary and end-of-service settlement, ensuring accurate and proportional compensation. The calculator allows organizations to adapt salary calculations to their specific operational requirements, accommodating variations in work periods and employment start/end dates. By providing granular control over salary proration, the tool helps maintain payroll accuracy and transparency. Super administrators can make real-time adjustments to proration settings, with changes immediately affecting active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. The system also includes safeguards to prevent unintended modifications by requiring manual rejection and resaving of existing prorated salary transactions when changes are made during an open payroll month.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar
