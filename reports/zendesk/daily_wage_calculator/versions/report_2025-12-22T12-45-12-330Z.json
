    "description": "The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides an automated mechanism to determine accurate pay reductions by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowances) by the number of actual working days in a month. The system intelligently handles different leave policies, accommodating both calendar day and working day calculations, and automatically accounts for public holidays that may impact the total working days. This feature ensures fair and transparent salary adjustments by systematically subtracting unpaid leave days from an employee's monthly compensation. By integrating with payroll and leave management systems, it streamlines the complex process of managing salary deductions, reduces manual calculation errors, and provides HR personnel with a reliable tool for handling unpaid leave scenarios. The calculator supports flexible leave policies and automatically generates precise payroll deductions, enhancing administrative efficiency and financial accuracy. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses previous limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The solution enables payroll managers to customize wage calculations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. This tool specifically supports critical payroll processes like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By accommodating different regional labor law requirements, such as the 30-day month standard in UAE and KSA, the calculator provides granular control over wage computations. The flexibility allows companies to align their payroll calculations with specific organizational policies and legal frameworks. Organizations can now handle complex wage calculations with greater accuracy and transparency, reducing manual computation errors and standardizing compensation processes. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool designed to help organizations proportionally calculate employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides super administrators with flexible options to prorate salaries using different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. The feature enables precise salary adjustments for an employee's first salary and end-of-service settlements, ensuring accurate compensation tracking. By allowing granular control over salary calculations, organizations can adapt their payroll processes to various employment scenarios and work arrangements. The tool integrates directly with the payroll system, automatically applying selected proration methods to active payroll transactions. This functionality helps maintain payroll accuracy, supports fair compensation practices, and provides administrative flexibility in managing employee earnings."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – Daily Wage Calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-22\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides an automated mechanism to determine accurate pay reductions by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowances) by the number of actual working days in a month. The system intelligently handles different leave policies, accommodating both calendar day and working day calculations, and automatically accounts for public holidays that may impact the total working days. This feature ensures fair and transparent salary adjustments by systematically subtracting unpaid leave days from an employee's monthly compensation. By integrating with payroll and leave management systems, it streamlines the complex process of managing salary deductions, reduces manual calculation errors, and provides HR personnel with a reliable tool for handling unpaid leave scenarios. The calculator supports flexible leave policies and automatically generates precise payroll deductions, enhancing administrative efficiency and financial accuracy. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses previous limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The solution enables payroll managers to customize wage calculations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. This tool specifically supports critical payroll processes like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By accommodating different regional labor law requirements, such as the 30-day month standard in UAE and KSA, the calculator provides granular control over wage computations. The flexibility allows companies to align their payroll calculations with specific organizational policies and legal frameworks. Organizations can now handle complex wage calculations with greater accuracy and transparency, reducing manual computation errors and standardizing compensation processes. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool designed to help organizations proportionally calculate employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides super administrators with flexible options to prorate salaries using different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. The feature enables precise salary adjustments for an employee's first salary and end-of-service settlements, ensuring accurate compensation tracking. By allowing granular control over salary calculations, organizations can adapt their payroll processes to various employment scenarios and work arrangements. The tool integrates directly with the payroll system, automatically applying selected proration methods to active payroll transactions. This functionality helps maintain payroll accuracy, supports fair compensation practices, and provides administrative flexibility in managing employee earnings.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n-
