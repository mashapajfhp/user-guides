## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing organizations to choose between calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) for calculations. A critical aspect of the feature is its ability to automatically account for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate salary reduction. This automated process helps HR personnel and payroll administrators manage leave-related financial adjustments with precision and consistency. By integrating with payroll systems, the daily wage calculator streamlines the complex task of prorating salaries based on unpaid leave, reducing manual calculation errors and ensuring fair compensation tracking. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses historical limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple computation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The calculator enables payroll managers to customize wage calculations by selecting specific salary components like basic salary, allowances, or combinations thereof. By supporting different calculation methods, the tool helps organizations accurately handle salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. It accommodates regional labor law requirements, such as the UAE and KSA standard of using 30 custom days for monthly calculations. The feature provides granular control by allowing exclusion of weekends and public holidays from wage computations. This flexibility ensures more accurate and compliant payroll processing across diverse organizational contexts and regulatory environments. The daily wage calculator is a payroll management tool that enables precise salary proration for employees based on actual days worked. It provides super administrators the capability to adjust salary calculations using flexible calculation bases including custom days, calendar days, or working days. This feature is critical for accurately computing proportional compensation during an employee's first salary period or end-of-service settlement. By offering granular control over salary calculation methods, organizations can ensure fair and precise compensation tracking. The tool allows administrators to make real-time adjustments to proration settings, with immediate impact on active payroll transactions. Its design supports complex payroll scenarios by providing multiple calculation methodologies that can be tailored to specific organizational payroll policies. The system ensures transparency and accuracy in salary computations by enabling detailed, day-based salary adjustments.
