## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system functionality designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. By systematically determining daily pay rates, the feature enables organizations to automatically adjust employee compensation based on actual working days. The calculator supports flexible leave policies by accommodating both calendar day and working day calculations, and intelligently accounts for public holidays when computing salary reductions. It provides HR personnel and payroll administrators with a standardized method to process unpaid leave requests, ensuring accurate and transparent financial adjustments. The system automatically generates payroll deductions by dividing an employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in a given month. This approach allows for precise, rule-based salary calculations that maintain fairness and compliance with organizational leave policies. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses historical limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The calculator enables payroll managers to customize wage computations by selecting specific salary components like basic salary, allowances, or combined elements. This solution supports critical payroll processes such as salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By accommodating different organizational policies and regional labor laws, particularly in UAE and KSA markets, the tool provides granular control over wage calculations. The system allows configuration of calculation methods that can exclude weekends and public holidays, ensuring accurate and compliant compensation tracking. Designed for flexibility, the daily wage calculator empowers payroll professionals to implement nuanced compensation strategies tailored to their specific organizational needs. The Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) is a sophisticated payroll management tool designed to help organizations precisely prorate employee salaries based on actual days worked. It enables super administrators to flexibly calculate compensation by selecting from multiple calculation bases including custom days, calendar days, or working days. This feature is critical for accurately adjusting an employee's first salary and end-of-service settlement, ensuring fair and proportional compensation. By providing granular control over salary calculations, the tool supports complex payroll scenarios where standard monthly salaries need proportional adjustment. The calculator integrates directly with the payroll system, allowing immediate updates that affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. Its primary value lies in providing payroll administrators with precise, configurable mechanisms to handle variable employment periods and compensation calculations.
