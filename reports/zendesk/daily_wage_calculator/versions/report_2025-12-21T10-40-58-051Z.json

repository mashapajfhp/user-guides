    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing organizations to use either calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the basis for calculations. A key sophistication of this tool is its ability to automatically account for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate pay deductions. This feature supports HR personnel and payroll administrators in managing leave-related salary adjustments with precision and consistency. By automating the complex process of prorating salaries for unpaid leave, the daily wage calculator reduces manual calculation errors and streamlines payroll processing. The system generates automatic pay deductions that are directly reflected in the payroll table, providing a transparent and efficient method of handling employee leave and compensation. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation on a daily basis. It addresses historical limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple computation approaches, including calendar days, working days, and custom day configurations. The calculator enables payroll professionals to customize wage calculations based on specific organizational needs, accounting for variations like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By supporting different calculation bases, the tool allows companies to align their wage computations with local labor regulations, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA. Users can select specific salary components for calculation, such as basic salary, allowances, or combined amounts, enhancing the system's adaptability. The tool provides granular control over wage calculations, accommodating diverse company policies and ensuring accurate, compliant compensation processing. Its sophisticated design supports complex payroll scenarios while simplifying the traditionally complex process of daily wage determination. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides flexible calculation methods including custom days, calendar days, and working days to accurately prorate salaries for first-month employees and end-of-service settlements. The feature allows precise salary adjustments by selecting different calculation bases, ensuring employees are compensated proportionally to their actual work period. By integrating directly with the payroll system, it helps organizations maintain accurate and fair compensation practices. Super administrators can modify calculation settings, which immediately impact active (unpaid) payroll amounts. The tool supports complex payroll scenarios by offering multiple calculation approaches, enhancing financial accuracy and administrative flexibility in salary processing."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-21\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing organizations to use either calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the basis for calculations. A key sophistication of this tool is its ability to automatically account for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate pay deductions. This feature supports HR personnel and payroll administrators in managing leave-related salary adjustments with precision and consistency. By automating the complex process of prorating salaries for unpaid leave, the daily wage calculator reduces manual calculation errors and streamlines payroll processing. The system generates automatic pay deductions that are directly reflected in the payroll table, providing a transparent and efficient method of handling employee leave and compensation. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation on a daily basis. It addresses historical limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple computation approaches, including calendar days, working days, and custom day configurations. The calculator enables payroll professionals to customize wage calculations based on specific organizational needs, accounting for variations like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By supporting different calculation bases, the tool allows companies to align their wage computations with local labor regulations, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA. Users can select specific salary components for calculation, such as basic salary, allowances, or combined amounts, enhancing the system's adaptability. The tool provides granular control over wage calculations, accommodating diverse company policies and ensuring accurate, compliant compensation processing. Its sophisticated design supports complex payroll scenarios while simplifying the traditionally complex process of daily wage determination. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides flexible calculation methods including custom days, calendar days, and working days to accurately prorate salaries for first-month employees and end-of-service settlements. The feature allows precise salary adjustments by selecting different calculation bases, ensuring employees are compensated proportionally to their actual work period. By integrating directly with the payroll system, it helps organizations maintain accurate and fair compensation practices. Super administrators can modify calculation settings, which immediately impact active (unpaid) payroll amounts. The tool supports complex payroll scenarios by offering multiple calculation approaches, enhancing financial accuracy and administrative flexibility in salary processing.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be
