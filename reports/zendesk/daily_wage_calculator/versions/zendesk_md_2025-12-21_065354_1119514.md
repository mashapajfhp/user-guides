## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for unpaid leave by determining an employee's daily pay rate. It enables HR personnel to automatically process leave-related salary adjustments by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, supporting both calendar day (30 days) and working day (e.g., 22 days) calculations. It intelligently accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the total working days, ensuring accurate and fair salary reductions. This systematic approach provides a transparent and consistent method for handling unpaid leave financial implications, reducing manual calculation errors and streamlining payroll processing. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation across various scenarios. It enables payroll managers to dynamically determine daily wage rates by selecting from multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, or custom days. The calculator addresses complex payroll challenges by allowing customization of salary component inclusions, such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. By supporting salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, the tool offers unprecedented control over wage calculations. Organizations can align the calculator with their specific labor law requirements, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA where custom 30-day calculations are prevalent. The solution eliminates previous limitations in daily rate computations by providing granular configuration options that account for variations in monthly work periods, public holidays, and company-specific policies. The daily wage calculator is a payroll management tool designed to help organizations proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. It enables super administrators to configure salary proration using multiple calculation methods, including custom days, calendar days, and working days. This feature is critical for accurately compensating employees during their first month of employment, during partial work periods, or when calculating end-of-service settlements. By providing flexible calculation bases, the tool ensures precise and fair salary adjustments that reflect an employee's actual work time. The calculator integrates directly with the payroll system, allowing administrators to make global changes that impact active (unpaid) payroll transactions. Its primary value lies in creating transparency and accuracy in compensation calculations, reducing manual errors and providing a standardized approach to prorating salaries across different employment scenarios.
