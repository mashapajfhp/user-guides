## Feature Overview

The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll system feature designed to automatically calculate and deduct pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining salary reductions by dividing an employee's total salary by the actual number of working days in a month. The calculator supports two primary leave policy approaches: calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days), with the critical capability of accounting for public holidays. By automatically generating precise pay deductions, the system ensures accurate and fair compensation adjustments when employees take unpaid leave. The feature integrates seamlessly with payroll systems, reducing manual calculation errors and streamlining HR administrative processes. It offers flexibility in handling different leave policies and provides a transparent method for calculating daily wage reductions. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll management tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses previous limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The calculator allows payroll managers to customize wage computations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. This solution supports critical payroll processes like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, enabling more accurate and compliant financial calculations. By accommodating different regional labor law requirements, such as the 30-day month standard in UAE and KSA, the tool provides significant flexibility for multinational or regionally diverse organizations. The calculator can exclude weekends and public holidays, ensuring precise daily wage calculations that align with specific company policies and operational calendars. Its design empowers payroll professionals to handle complex compensation scenarios with greater efficiency and accuracy. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool designed to help organizations proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides super administrators with flexible calculation methods for prorating salaries, which impacts both initial salary payments and end-of-service settlements. The system allows selecting from multiple calculation bases including custom days, calendar days, and working days, enabling precise salary adjustments. By offering granular control over salary calculations, the feature ensures accurate compensation reflecting an employee's actual work period. The tool integrates directly with the payroll system, allowing administrators to make real-time changes that immediately affect active payroll transactions. This functionality is particularly useful for handling partial month employments, variable work schedules, and ensuring fair compensation calculations. The calculator supports administrative workflows by providing a systematic approach to managing prorated salary computations.
