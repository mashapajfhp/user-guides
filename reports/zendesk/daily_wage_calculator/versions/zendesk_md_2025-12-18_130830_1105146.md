## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system function designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing organizations to use either calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the basis for calculations. A critical feature of this tool is its ability to automatically account for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate pay deduction. By integrating with payroll systems, the calculator generates automatic deductions that are directly reflected in the employee's payroll table. This feature helps HR personnel and payroll administrators manage leave-related salary adjustments with precision and consistency, reducing manual calculation errors and ensuring fair compensation practices. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. By offering multiple calculation bases such as calendar days, working days, and custom days, the feature enables precise salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. Companies can customize their wage calculations by selecting specific salary components like basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. The calculator addresses previous limitations in daily rate computations by introducing granular control over wage calculations. It supports different regional labor law requirements, particularly in UAE and KSA markets, where 30-day calculation methods are common. The tool is specifically engineered for payroll professionals to streamline complex wage computation processes, reduce manual calculations, and ensure accuracy in employee compensation. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool designed to help organizations precisely prorate employee salaries based on actual days worked. It enables super administrators to flexibly calculate compensation by selecting different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. This feature is critical for accurately adjusting an employee's first salary and end-of-service settlement, ensuring fair and proportional compensation. By providing granular control over salary calculations, the tool helps organizations maintain precise payroll management and adapt to varying employment scenarios. The calculator allows for dynamic adjustments to salary proration settings, which immediately impact active payroll transactions. Super administrators can make these calculations with precision, rejecting and resaving prorated salary transactions as needed to maintain payroll accuracy.
