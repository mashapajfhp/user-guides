## Feature Overview

The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator supports two leave policy approaches: calendar days (30 days) or working days (typically 22 days), with the critical capability of automatically adjusting for public holidays. By subtracting public holidays from working days, the system ensures accurate and fair salary calculations. This feature streamlines HR and payroll processes by automating complex salary reduction calculations, reducing manual computational errors. It offers flexibility in handling different leave policies while maintaining consistent and transparent payroll management. The tool is particularly valuable for organizations seeking precise, rule-based approaches to managing employee compensation during periods of unpaid leave. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll management tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses previous limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The solution enables payroll managers to customize wage calculations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. This tool specifically supports critical payroll processes like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By accommodating different regional labor law requirements, such as the 30-day month standard in UAE and KSA, the calculator provides a configurable approach to wage computation. The system allows administrators to exclude weekends and public holidays, ensuring more accurate and context-specific daily wage calculations. Ultimately, the Daily Wage Calculator empowers organizations to implement more nuanced and policy-aligned compensation strategies. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool designed to help organizations proportionally calculate employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides super administrators with flexible methods to prorate salaries, accommodating various calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. This feature is critical for accurately adjusting compensation during an employee's first salary period or end-of-service settlement. By allowing granular control over salary calculations, organizations can ensure precise and fair compensation tracking. The tool integrates directly with the payroll system, enabling administrators to make real-time adjustments that immediately impact active payroll transactions. Its primary purpose is to simplify complex salary calculations and provide transparency in wage determination. The system offers built-in flexibility to handle different employment scenarios and calculation preferences, making it a versatile solution for payroll management.
