## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It enables HR personnel to automatically determine pay reductions by dividing an employee's total monthly salary by the number of actual working days, accounting for variations in leave policies and public holidays. The system supports two primary calculation methods: using calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days), with the flexibility to subtract public holidays from the total working days. This automated approach ensures accurate, consistent, and transparent salary adjustments when employees take approved unpaid leave. By integrating leave management with payroll systems, the feature streamlines administrative processes, reduces manual calculation errors, and provides a standardized method for handling salary deductions. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation across different scenarios. It enables payroll managers to compute daily wage rates using multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, or custom days, allowing for nuanced salary prorations and adjustments. The calculator supports various salary component selections, such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, giving companies granular control over wage calculations. By accommodating different labor law requirements and organizational policies, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA, the tool helps ensure accurate and compliant wage computations. The system can handle complex scenarios like leave encashment, unpaid leave deductions, and salary prorations with enhanced customization. Its primary value lies in reducing manual calculation errors, providing transparency in wage computation, and offering configurable options that align with diverse organizational payroll practices. The calculator represents a significant advancement from traditional limited wage calculation methods, introducing more sophisticated and adaptable approaches to daily rate determination. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to precisely prorate employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides flexible calculation methods including custom days, calendar days, and working days, allowing organizations to accurately adjust compensation for partial work periods. This feature is critical for handling first-month salaries and end-of-service settlements with granular precision. By offering multiple calculation bases, the tool supports complex payroll scenarios where standard monthly salary calculations may not suffice. Super administrators can dynamically modify salary proration settings, ensuring financial accuracy and transparency. The calculator integrates directly with the payroll system, automatically updating active (unpaid) amounts when changes are made. Its design emphasizes administrative control and computational flexibility in salary management.
