## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll management tool designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic method for determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing organizations to use either calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the basis for calculations. A critical feature of this tool is its ability to automatically account for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate pay deductions. By integrating with payroll systems, the calculator generates automatic deductions that are directly reflected in the payroll table, streamlining the complex process of managing unpaid leave and salary adjustments. This feature helps HR personnel and payroll administrators maintain precise financial records and ensures fair, consistent treatment of employee leave and compensation. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses previous limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The tool enables payroll managers to customize wage calculations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. By supporting different calculation methods, the system supports critical payroll processes like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. The calculator accommodates regional labor law requirements, particularly for companies in UAE and KSA that typically use 30-day calculation methods. Its flexibility allows organizations to align wage calculations with their specific company policies and legal frameworks. The tool provides granular control over wage computation, reducing manual calculation errors and standardizing payroll processes across different employee categories. The daily wage calculator is a payroll management tool designed to proportionally adjust employee compensation based on actual days worked.

By providing flexible calculation methods, organizations can adapt salary calculations to their specific business rules and employment scenarios. The tool integrates directly with the payroll system, allowing administrators to make real-time adjustments that immediately impact active payroll transactions.
