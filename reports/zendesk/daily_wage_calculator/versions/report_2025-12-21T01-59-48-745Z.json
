    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic method for determining the appropriate daily pay reduction by dividing an employee's total salary by the actual number of working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing organizations to choose between calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the basis for calculation. A key sophistication of this tool is its ability to automatically account for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate salary calculations. This feature streamlines the complex process of managing unpaid leave, reducing manual intervention and potential errors in payroll processing. By providing a transparent and consistent method of calculating daily wage deductions, the system helps maintain fair and precise compensation practices. The calculator integrates directly with payroll systems, enabling automatic generation of pay deductions upon approval of unpaid leave requests. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It enables payroll managers to dynamically compute daily wage rates using multiple calculation bases such as calendar days, working days, or custom days. This feature addresses complex salary computation scenarios like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By offering granular control over calculation parameters, the tool allows companies to align wage computations with their specific organizational policies and local labor regulations. Users can select different salary components for calculations, including basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. The calculator supports customization based on regional labor laws, with many UAE and KSA companies using a 30-day standard for wage calculations. Its primary goal is to introduce transparency, accuracy, and adaptability into daily wage computation processes. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. This feature provides flexibility in calculating compensation by offering multiple calculation bases including custom days, calendar days, and working days. It plays a critical role in accurately prorating salaries for employees' first month of work and end-of-service settlements. The calculator allows precise financial adjustments by giving administrators the ability to select appropriate calculation methods that reflect the organization's specific payroll requirements. By integrating directly with the payroll system, it ensures that salary calculations are transparent, configurable, and aligned with organizational policies. The tool is particularly valuable for handling partial month employments, ensuring employees are compensated fairly and accurately. Super administrators can make real-time adjustments to salary proration settings, with changes immediately impacting active payroll transactions."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-21\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic method for determining the appropriate daily pay reduction by dividing an employee's total salary by the actual number of working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing organizations to choose between calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the basis for calculation. A key sophistication of this tool is its ability to automatically account for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate salary calculations. This feature streamlines the complex process of managing unpaid leave, reducing manual intervention and potential errors in payroll processing. By providing a transparent and consistent method of calculating daily wage deductions, the system helps maintain fair and precise compensation practices. The calculator integrates directly with payroll systems, enabling automatic generation of pay deductions upon approval of unpaid leave requests. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It enables payroll managers to dynamically compute daily wage rates using multiple calculation bases such as calendar days, working days, or custom days. This feature addresses complex salary computation scenarios like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By offering granular control over calculation parameters, the tool allows companies to align wage computations with their specific organizational policies and local labor regulations. Users can select different salary components for calculations, including basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. The calculator supports customization based on regional labor laws, with many UAE and KSA companies using a 30-day standard for wage calculations. Its primary goal is to introduce transparency, accuracy, and adaptability into daily wage computation processes. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. This feature provides flexibility in calculating compensation by offering multiple calculation bases including custom days, calendar days, and working days. It plays a critical role in accurately prorating salaries for employees' first month of work and end-of-service settlements. The calculator allows precise financial adjustments by giving administrators the ability to select appropriate calculation methods that reflect the organization's specific payroll requirements. By integrating directly with the payroll system, it ensures that salary calculations are transparent, configurable, and aligned with organizational policies. The tool is particularly valuable for handling partial month employments, ensuring employees are compensated fairly and accurately. Super administrators can make real-time adjustments to salary proration settings, with changes immediately impacting active payroll transactions.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct
