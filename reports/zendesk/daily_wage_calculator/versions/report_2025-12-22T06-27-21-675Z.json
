    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate and automatically deduct pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic method for determining salary reductions by dividing an employee's total monthly salary (basic pay plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in a given month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing organizations to choose between calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) for calculations. A critical aspect of this feature is its ability to intelligently account for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate salary deductions. By automating this complex calculation process, the daily wage calculator helps HR personnel and payroll administrators maintain precision in salary management, reduce manual calculation errors, and ensure fair and transparent handling of unpaid leave compensation. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses historical limitations in salary prorations by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The calculator allows payroll managers to customize wage calculations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. This feature supports critical payroll processes like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By accommodating different regional labor law requirements, such as the 30-day month standard in UAE and KSA, the tool provides significant flexibility for diverse organizational needs. The calculator enables more accurate and transparent wage calculations by allowing granular control over computation parameters. Its design empowers payroll professionals to implement company-specific compensation policies with greater precision and ease. The daily wage calculator is a payroll management tool designed to help organizations proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides super administrators with flexible methods to calculate prorated salaries using different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. This feature is critical for handling complex salary scenarios like first-month employment, partial work periods, and end-of-service settlements. By allowing precise salary calculations, the tool ensures accurate compensation reflecting an employee's actual work duration. The calculator integrates directly with the payroll system, enabling administrators to make real-time adjustments that immediately impact active payroll transactions. Its primary value lies in providing transparency, flexibility, and accuracy in salary computations across varying employment scenarios."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-22\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate and automatically deduct pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic method for determining salary reductions by dividing an employee's total monthly salary (basic pay plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in a given month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing organizations to choose between calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) for calculations. A critical aspect of this feature is its ability to intelligently account for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate salary deductions. By automating this complex calculation process, the daily wage calculator helps HR personnel and payroll administrators maintain precision in salary management, reduce manual calculation errors, and ensure fair and transparent handling of unpaid leave compensation. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses historical limitations in salary prorations by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The calculator allows payroll managers to customize wage calculations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. This feature supports critical payroll processes like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By accommodating different regional labor law requirements, such as the 30-day month standard in UAE and KSA, the tool provides significant flexibility for diverse organizational needs. The calculator enables more accurate and transparent wage calculations by allowing granular control over computation parameters. Its design empowers payroll professionals to implement company-specific compensation policies with greater precision and ease. The daily wage calculator is a payroll management tool designed to help organizations proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides super administrators with flexible methods to calculate prorated salaries using different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. This feature is critical for handling complex salary scenarios like first-month employment, partial work periods, and end-of-service settlements. By allowing precise salary calculations, the tool ensures accurate compensation reflecting an employee's actual work duration. The calculator integrates directly with the payroll system, enabling administrators to make real-time adjustments that immediately impact active payroll transactions. Its primary value lies in providing transparency, flexibility, and accuracy in salary computations across varying employment scenarios.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay
