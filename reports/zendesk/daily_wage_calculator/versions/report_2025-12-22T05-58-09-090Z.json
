    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate and deduct employee pay for unpaid leave periods. It provides a systematic approach for HR personnel to automatically reduce an employee's salary based on the number of days not worked, taking into account complex factors like working days, calendar days, and public holidays. The calculator allows organizations to flexibly apply different leave policies by supporting both calendar day (30 days) and working day (e.g., 22 days) calculation methods. By automatically generating pay deductions and reflecting them in the payroll table, the system ensures accurate and transparent salary adjustments for unpaid leave. The calculation methodology involves dividing the total salary (basic + allowance) by the actual number of working days, with public holidays strategically subtracted to determine the precise daily pay rate. This feature streamlines payroll processing, reduces manual calculation errors, and provides a standardized approach to managing employee leave-related salary deductions. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses previous limitations in wage calculations by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The solution enables payroll managers to customize wage calculations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. By supporting different calculation methods, the tool helps organizations accurately manage salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. It accommodates regional labor law requirements, particularly for companies in UAE and KSA that typically use 30-day calculation standards. The calculator provides granular control over wage computations by allowing exclusion of weekends and public holidays from calculations. This flexibility ensures more accurate and compliant payroll processing across diverse organizational contexts and workforce structures. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to precisely prorate employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides flexible calculation methods including custom days, calendar days, and working days to accurately adjust compensation for partial pay periods. The feature is critical for handling first-time salary calculations and end-of-service settlements, ensuring employees receive proportional pay reflecting their actual work time. By allowing granular control over salary calculation bases, organizations can implement fair and transparent compensation adjustments. The tool integrates directly with the payroll system, automatically updating active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. Super administrators can make real-time changes to proration settings, with built-in safeguards to manage open payroll months and existing salary transactions."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-22\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate and deduct employee pay for unpaid leave periods. It provides a systematic approach for HR personnel to automatically reduce an employee's salary based on the number of days not worked, taking into account complex factors like working days, calendar days, and public holidays. The calculator allows organizations to flexibly apply different leave policies by supporting both calendar day (30 days) and working day (e.g., 22 days) calculation methods. By automatically generating pay deductions and reflecting them in the payroll table, the system ensures accurate and transparent salary adjustments for unpaid leave. The calculation methodology involves dividing the total salary (basic + allowance) by the actual number of working days, with public holidays strategically subtracted to determine the precise daily pay rate. This feature streamlines payroll processing, reduces manual calculation errors, and provides a standardized approach to managing employee leave-related salary deductions. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses previous limitations in wage calculations by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The solution enables payroll managers to customize wage calculations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. By supporting different calculation methods, the tool helps organizations accurately manage salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. It accommodates regional labor law requirements, particularly for companies in UAE and KSA that typically use 30-day calculation standards. The calculator provides granular control over wage computations by allowing exclusion of weekends and public holidays from calculations. This flexibility ensures more accurate and compliant payroll processing across diverse organizational contexts and workforce structures. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to precisely prorate employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides flexible calculation methods including custom days, calendar days, and working days to accurately adjust compensation for partial pay periods. The feature is critical for handling first-time salary calculations and end-of-service settlements, ensuring employees receive proportional pay reflecting their actual work time. By allowing granular control over salary calculation bases, organizations can implement fair and transparent compensation adjustments. The tool integrates directly with the payroll system, automatically updating active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. Super administrators can make real-time changes to proration settings, with built-in safeguards to manage open payroll months and existing salary transactions.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n-
