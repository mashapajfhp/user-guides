## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for unpaid leave. It automatically processes leave requests by determining daily pay rates based on an employee's total salary divided by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator supports flexible leave policies, allowing organizations to choose between calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) for calculations. It intelligently accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the total working days, ensuring accurate and fair salary reductions. This tool streamlines HR processes by automating complex salary calculations, reducing manual intervention, and providing a transparent method for handling unpaid leave financial adjustments. The system integrates directly with payroll tables, generating automatic deductions that reflect the precise number of unpaid leave days taken by an employee. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses previous limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The calculator allows payroll managers to customize wage computations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. This solution supports critical payroll processes like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By accommodating different regional labor law requirements, such as the 30-day standard in UAE and KSA, the tool provides greater accuracy and compliance. The calculator's flexibility enables companies to align wage calculations with their specific organizational policies and regulatory frameworks. It represents a significant improvement in payroll management by offering granular control over daily wage computations. The daily wage calculator is a payroll management tool designed to help organizations proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. It enables super administrators to configure salary proration using flexible calculation methods such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. This feature is crucial for accurately compensating employees during their first month of employment, during partial work periods, or when calculating end-of-service settlements. By providing granular control over salary calculations, the tool ensures precise and fair compensation tracking. The system allows administrators to modify calculation bases dynamically, with changes immediately impacting active payroll transactions. This functionality supports complex payroll scenarios and provides transparency in salary computation, reducing manual calculation errors and administrative overhead.
