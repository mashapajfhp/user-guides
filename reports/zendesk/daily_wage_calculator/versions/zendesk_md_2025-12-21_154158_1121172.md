## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to automatically calculate and deduct pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a precise mechanism for determining salary reductions by dividing an employee's total monthly salary (basic + allowances) by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator supports two leave policy approaches: calendar days (30-day month) or working days (typically 22 days), with the unique capability of automatically subtracting public holidays from the working days calculation. This ensures accurate and fair salary deductions that reflect the exact number of days an employee is absent, creating a transparent and systematic approach to managing unpaid leave financial adjustments. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It addresses previous limitations in wage calculation by offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The solution enables payroll managers to customize wage calculations by selecting specific salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. This tool specifically supports critical payroll processes like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By accommodating different regional labor law requirements, such as the 30-day month standard in UAE and KSA, the calculator provides a configurable approach to wage computation. The system allows for nuanced calculations that can exclude weekends and public holidays, ensuring accurate and compliant compensation tracking. Ultimately, the daily wage calculator empowers payroll professionals to implement more sophisticated and context-aware wage calculation strategies. The daily wage calculator is a sophisticated payroll management tool designed to help organizations proportionally calculate employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides super administrators with flexible calculation methods for prorating salaries, including options for custom days, calendar days, and working days. This feature is crucial for accurately adjusting compensation during an employee's first salary period or end-of-service settlement. By allowing granular control over salary calculations, the tool ensures precise and fair compensation tracking. The system enables administrators to make real-time adjustments to salary proration settings, which immediately impact active payroll transactions. It supports complex payroll scenarios by offering multiple calculation bases that can be tailored to an organization's specific compensation policies. The tool is particularly valuable for managing partial month salaries, new employee onboarding, and employee departures.
