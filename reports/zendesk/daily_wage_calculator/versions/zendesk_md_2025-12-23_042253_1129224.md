## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature designed to automatically calculate and deduct pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining salary reductions by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator supports two leave policy approaches: calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days), with the critical capability of accounting for public holidays. When an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a precise pay deduction reflected in the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and fair compensation adjustments, helping HR personnel and payroll administrators manage leave-related salary calculations with precision and efficiency. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It enables payroll managers to dynamically compute daily wage rates using multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The solution addresses complex payroll challenges by allowing customization of salary component inclusions, such as basic salary, allowances, or combined calculations. By supporting salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, the calculator offers granular control over wage computations. The tool accommodates regional labor law requirements, with specific configurations like the 30-day standard used in UAE and KSA markets. Its flexibility allows companies to align wage calculations with their specific organizational policies and regulatory standards. The calculator simplifies previously complex manual wage computations, reducing administrative overhead and potential calculation errors. By providing multiple calculation perspectives, it supports more accurate and transparent employee compensation management. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. This sophisticated system allows precise salary calculations by offering multiple calculation bases including custom days, calendar days, and working days. The feature is critical for accurately prorating salaries during an employee's first month of work or final service settlement. By providing flexible calculation methods, organizations can ensure fair and accurate compensation that reflects the exact duration and type of work performed. The tool integrates directly with the payroll system, allowing immediate updates that impact active (unpaid) payroll transactions. Super administrators can make granular adjustments to salary calculations, ensuring compliance with complex compensation scenarios. The system also includes safeguards to prevent unintended changes by requiring manual rejection and resaving of existing prorated salary transactions when settings are modified.
