## Validation Complete

I have completed my exploration of the Leave Management feature in the Bayzat HR application. Here's what I accomplished:

### ✅ Successfully Completed:
1. **Login** - Successfully authenticated using the provided credentials
2. **Navigation** - Accessed the Leave Management feature via Time > Employee leaves
3. **UI Exploration** - Documented the main leave request list interface with 192 requests
4. **Screenshots** - Captured 8 screenshots of key screens

### 📊 Key Findings:

**What Works:**
- Leave request listing with comprehensive information (employee, type, dates, duration)
- Multi-level approval workflow visibility showing approval chain status
- Quick approve/reject actions directly from list view
- Filtering and pagination for managing large datasets
- Clear visual employee identification with photos

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Calendar tab is non-functional
- Leave request detail views cannot be accessed
- **Critical**: Settings navigation is broken - cannot access Leaves Settings or Payroll Settings
- **Blocked**: Cannot validate leave encashment and end-of-service configuration (the primary task)

The complete JSON validation report has been generated above with full details of all screens explored, UI elements documented, and issues encountered.
