Workflow integration confirmed with 3 triggers available in Bayzat Attendance app (shift created, updated, deleted). Approval flow confirmed with dedicated Shift Change Request tab supporting multi-step approvals. Primary limitation OS-299 validated: UI does not provide clear path to add second shift when one already exists on a day. Feature is functional for shift scheduling with calendar interface, work center filters, and employee-based shift assignment. Successfully created, modified, and deleted test shifts for validation purposes."
