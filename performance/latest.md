## What is Performance Management?

### Overview

Bayzat Performance Management offers **two distinct approaches** to evaluating and developing employees, each designed for different organizational needs:

<div class="feature-grid">

<div class="feature-card">

#### 1. Goals-Based Performance

A structured, cycle-based system for setting, tracking, and reviewing employee goals. Performance Cycles define specific periods for goal setting, tracking, reviews, and calibration.

**Navigation:** Performance → Goals \| Reviews \| My Performance

**Best for:** Structured annual/quarterly reviews tied to measurable objectives

</div>

<div class="feature-card">

#### 2. 360° Reviews (Beta)

A standalone feedback system for gathering multi-directional input. Collect feedback from managers, peers, and direct reports independently of performance cycles.

**Navigation:** Performance → 360° Reviews \| My 360° Reviews

**Best for:** Comprehensive feedback on competencies and behaviors from multiple perspectives

</div>

</div>

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Goals-Based Performance | 360° Reviews |
|----|----|----|
| **Structure** | Tied to Performance Cycles with defined phases | Independent review cycles, can run anytime |
| **Primary Focus** | Goal achievement and tracking | Multi-directional feedback collection |
| **Workflow** | Goal Setting → Tracking → Review → Calibration | Create Review → Peer Nominations → Collect Feedback → Reports |
| **Feedback Sources** | Self-assessment + Manager review | Self + Manager + Peers + Direct Reports |
| **Statuses** | Draft → Pending Approval → Approved | Draft → Pending Peer Nominations → Ongoing → Completed |
| **Feature Status** | Full release | Beta |

### Key Benefits

- Create and manage comprehensive performance review cycles with structured phases
- Set and track employee goals with approval workflows and weight balancing
- Conduct 360° feedback reviews for holistic performance insights from multiple perspectives
- Configure custom rating scales and goal types to match your organization's methodology
- Record catch-ups to document one-on-one meetings and ongoing feedback

### Who Uses This Feature?

| User Role | What They Do | Value Proposition |
|----|----|----|
| **HR Administrators** | Configure performance cycles, rating scales, and goal types. Manage organization-wide performance settings and monitor cycle progress across the company. | Run structured performance cycles that complete on time with full participation—eliminating manual tracking and last-minute review scrambles |
| **Managers** | Conduct performance reviews, provide feedback on employee goals, and participate in calibration sessions. Write evaluations and track team member development. | Give meaningful feedback with full context on goals and achievements—rather than scrambling to recall a year's worth of performance at review time |
| **Employees** | Set personal goals, complete self-assessments, view performance feedback, and participate in 360° reviews as nominees or reviewers. | Own your career development with clear goals and regular feedback—understanding exactly where you stand and what growth looks like |

### How Performance Management Fits

Performance Management provides **two complementary evaluation systems** that can be used independently or together based on your organization's needs.

<div class="info-box">

**Goals-Based Mental Model:** HR creates cycle → Employees set goals → Manager approves goals → Goal tracking period → Self-assessment → Manager review → Calibration session → Cycle completes with documented outcomes.

</div>

<div class="info-box">

**360° Reviews Mental Model:** HR starts review → Select employees → Peer nominations → Feedback collection from all directions (self, manager, peers, reports) → Generate comprehensive feedback reports.

</div>

Organizations often use Goals-Based Performance for structured quarterly or annual reviews tied to objectives, while 360° Reviews provide additional behavioral and competency feedback from multiple perspectives.

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Key Decisions Before Setup

Answer these questions before creating a performance cycle:

- **What is the cycle frequency?** — Annual, semi-annual, or quarterly cycles based on your organization's needs
- **What rating scale will you use?** — Configure rating levels with labels and descriptions
- **Will you include goal tracking?** — Enable goal management with approval workflows
- **Will you use 360° feedback?** — Add peer feedback for comprehensive insights

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Related Features

- **Employee Profiles** — View employee details and reporting relationships used in review assignments
- **People Directory** — Organizational structure that defines manager-employee relationships
- **Org Chart** — Visual hierarchy used to determine review chains and calibration groups
- **Notifications** — Alerts employees and managers about review deadlines and goal approvals

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Prerequisites & Requirements

| Requirement | Description | Status |
|----|----|----|
| Active Bayzat HR Account | Performance Management is a module within Bayzat HR platform | Required |
| Employee Records | Employees must exist in the system before inclusion in cycles | Required |
| Organizational Structure | Manager-employee relationships must be defined for review workflows | Required |
| Rating Scales | Define the rating system for evaluations before creating cycles | Required |

## Feature Usage

### Common Workflows

#### Goal Setting (Employee)

Employees create and submit goals for manager approval during the goal-setting phase of a performance cycle.

#### Self-Assessment (Employee)

Employees evaluate their own performance against goals and provide self-ratings during the review period.

#### Manager Review (Manager)

Managers evaluate team members' performance, provide ratings, and write feedback.

### Setting Goals (Employee Flow)

Employees set goals through the Performance menu. Goals progress through Draft, Pending, and Approved statuses.

#### Creating Goals via My Performance

Employees can create their own goals directly from the "My Performance" section. This is the self-service view for managing your individual performance.

<div class="nav-path">

**Employee Goal Creation Path**

<figcaption>Goal type options configured by your organization</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Understanding Goal Weightages

Goal weights communicate the relative importance of each goal. The system enforces that **the total weight of all goals assigned to an employee must equal 100%**.

<div class="warning-box">

**Important - Goal Weight Balancing:** When creating multiple goals, ensure that the weights add up to exactly 100%. For example:

- Goal 1: 40%
- Goal 2: 35%
- Goal 3: 25%
- **Total: 100%**

Goals cannot be finalized if the total weight does not equal 100%.

</div>

<div class="info-box">

**Quick Filter for Weight Issues:** HR and managers can use the "Employees with goals weight needs review" quick filter on the Goals page to identify employees whose goal weights don't balance to 100%.

</div>

#### HR/Manager Goal Management View

HR administrators and managers can view and manage employee goals through the Performance → Goals page.

#### Goals Page Quick Filters

The Goals page provides quick filters to help HR and managers identify employees needing attention:

- **Employees without goals:** Employees who haven't created any goals yet
- **Employees with goals weight needs review:** Goals don't add up to 100%
- **Pending employee confirmation on goals:** Goals awaiting employee acknowledgment

<div class="info-box">

**Pending Employee Confirmation:** When goals are created by HR or managers, employees must confirm them. Use the "Send reminder" button to notify employees who haven't confirmed their goals.

#### Managing 360° Reviews (5 Tabs)

Once a 360° review is created, it can be managed through five tabs:

| Tab | Purpose | Key Features |
|----|----|----|
| **Overview** | Dashboard view of review progress | Metrics cards (Employees Involved, Peer Nominations Progress, Survey Questions, Launch Readiness), Timeline/Milestones, Actions & Reminders, Participation Breakdown, Activity History |

| **Reports** | View consolidated feedback | Individual reports per participant combining all reviewer feedback (available after responses are collected) |

#### Four Survey Types

360° Reviews use four distinct survey types, each designed for a specific reviewer perspective:

<div class="feature-grid">

<div class="feature-card">

#### Self Review

Sent to the employee to reflect on their own contributions and development. Enables self-awareness and comparison with external feedback.

</div>

<div class="feature-card">

#### Manager Review

Sent to the employee's direct manager to provide performance feedback and development insights from a supervisory perspective.

</div>

<div class="feature-card">

#### Direct Reports Review

Sent to employees who report directly to the person being reviewed. Provides upward feedback on management and leadership behaviors.

</div>

<div class="feature-card">

#### Peer Review

Sent to nominated peers who work closely with the employee. Helps capture collaboration dynamics and team impact.

</div>

</div>

#### Question Bank & Feedback Categories

360° Reviews include a pre-built question bank organized into 8 feedback categories:

- **Problem Solving** - Questions about analytical thinking and solution-finding
- **Technical Expertise** - Questions about job-specific skills and knowledge
- **Leadership & Influence** - Questions about guiding and motivating others

Each question in the bank has variants tailored for different perspectives (Employee self-review, Manager, Direct Reports, and Peer), ensuring appropriate phrasing for each reviewer type.

#### Survey Question Types

Survey questions can use three different response formats:

- **Opinion Scale** - Rating scale questions (e.g., 1-5 or Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)
- **Multiple Choice** - Select one or more options from predefined answers
- **Free Text** - Open-ended questions for detailed written feedback

<div class="tip-box">

**Bulk Survey Creation:** Use the "Create all surveys" button to generate standardized surveys for all four participant types at once. Individual surveys can be customized later if needed.

</div>

#### Responses Tab Tracking

The Responses tab provides comprehensive tracking of feedback collection progress:

- **Quick filters:** All, Not started, In progress, Completed
- **Employee list:** Shows each participant with their response count (e.g., "0/4" meaning 0 of 4 expected responses received)
- **Status indicators:** Not started, In progress, or Completed for each employee
- **Actions:** View detailed breakdown by reviewer type, Send reminders to pending reviewers

Click "View" for any employee to see their feedback broken down by reviewer type (Employee, Line Manager, Direct Reports, Peer) with individual response status for each.

#### Managing Peer Nominations

HR administrators and managers can manage peer nominations through a dedicated interface. Click "Manage" for any employee in the Peer Nominations tab to access:

- **Employee and Line Manager Info:** Shows the employee being reviewed and their assigned line manager

<div class="info-box">

**Direct Report Restriction:** Direct reports cannot be selected as peer reviewers. The system automatically disables this option with the message: "Direct reportees cannot be selected as peer reviewers."

</div>

#### Peer Nomination Quick Filters

The Peer Nominations tab provides quick filters to track nomination progress:

- **All:** Shows all employees in the review
- **No Peers:** Employees who have no peers assigned yet
- **Pending Peers:** Employees with nominations in progress
- **Completed:** Employees with finalized peer nominations

#### AI-Suggested Peers

When managing peer nominations, the system offers AI-suggested peers based on collaboration patterns. This feature helps identify relevant reviewers who work closely with the employee.

<div class="info-box">

**How to Use AI Suggestions:** In the Peer Nominations tab, click "Manage" for any employee. Look for the "Add AI suggested peers" button which appears alongside suggested colleague names. Click it to automatically include these recommendations in the peer list.

</div>

#### 360° Review Statuses

### Understanding Performance Cycle Statuses (Current vs Past)

Performance cycles in Bayzat have two distinct statuses that determine what actions can be performed on them: **Current** (open/active) and **Past** (closed/completed).

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/85-performance-cycles-settings.png" class="screenshot" alt="Performance cycles list showing Current and Past status" />
<figcaption>Performance cycles settings page showing Current and Past cycle statuses</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Current Cycles (Open)

A **Current** cycle is an active performance cycle that is either ongoing or scheduled to start. Current cycles have the following characteristics:

- **Editable:** Cycle settings, employee inclusion/exclusion, and configurations can be modified
- **Deletable:** The cycle can be completely removed from the system
- **Active:** Employees can participate in goal setting, self-reviews, and receive manager reviews
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time tracking of completion rates across all review stages

<div class="info-box">

**When is a cycle "Current"?** A cycle remains in Current status as long as any of its activity stages (goal setting, self-review, manager review, calibration) are scheduled to occur or are in progress.

</div>

#### Past Cycles (Closed)

A **Past** cycle is a completed performance cycle where all review stages have concluded. Past cycles have the following characteristics:

- **Read-only:** Cycle settings and configurations cannot be modified
- **Cannot be deleted:** The cycle is permanently retained for historical records
- **Archived data:** All reviews, ratings, and feedback are preserved
- **Reopenable:** A "Reopen cycle" option is available to convert it back to Current status

<div class="warning-box">

**Important - Data Preservation:** Past cycles cannot be deleted to ensure historical performance data is retained for compliance, auditing, and employee records. If you need to remove a Past cycle, you must first reopen it to convert it to Current status.

</div>

#### Impact of Cycle Status on Available Actions

| Action | Current Cycle | Past Cycle |
|----|----|----|
| View cycle details | Yes | Yes |
| Edit cycle settings | Yes | No |
| Delete cycle | Yes | No (must reopen first) |
| Add/remove employees | Yes | No |
| Employees submit goals | Yes (during goal setting phase) | No |
| Complete self-reviews | Yes (during self-review phase) | No |
| Manager reviews | Yes (during manager review phase) | No |
| View historical data | Yes | Yes |
| Reopen cycle | N/A (already open) | Yes |

#### Reopening a Past Cycle

If you need to make changes to a completed cycle or allow additional reviews to be submitted, you can reopen a Past cycle:

1.  Navigate to Settings → Performance → Cycles
2.  Filter by "Past" status to view closed cycles
3.  Click on the cycle you wish to reopen
4.  Click the "Reopen cycle" button
5.  Confirm the action when prompted

<div class="warning-box">

**Caution:** Reopening a cycle makes it active again and allows modifications. This may affect employees who have already completed their reviews. Consider the impact on your team before reopening a cycle.

</div>

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/84-performance-cycle-dropdown.png" class="screenshot" alt="Performance cycle dropdown showing Current and Past filter options" />

<div id="workflow-integration" class="section">

## Workflow Integration

<div class="warning-box">

**Important:** Performance Management does not currently integrate with Bayzat Workflows. Automated triggers and actions are not available for performance-related events. All cycle progression and notifications are managed within the Performance module itself.

</div>

During validation, we searched through all 13 available workflow applications in the Bayzat platform (Timesheet, Employee Ticket, Accounts Payable, Knowledge Hub, HR, Recurring Events, Timeoff, Newsfeed, Payroll, Custom Fields, Insurance, Incoming Integration, and Attendance). Performance Management was not found in the workflow applications list.

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/16-workflow-applications-list.png" class="screenshot" alt="Available workflow applications list" />
<figcaption>Available workflow applications - Performance Management not included</figcaption>
</figure>

### Current Workarounds

Until workflow integration is available, consider these manual alternatives:

<div class="tip-box">

**Email Reminders:** Use calendar reminders or email scheduling tools to send review deadline notifications manually.

</div>

<div class="tip-box">

**Status Tracking:** Maintain a spreadsheet or project management tool to track review completion status across the organization.

</div>

### Potential Future Automation Scenarios

While not currently available, workflow automation could add value in these scenarios:

- **Automated Review Reminders:** Send notifications when review deadlines approach
- **Goal Approval Notifications:** Alert managers when employees submit goals for approval
- **Cycle Completion Workflows:** Trigger follow-up actions when cycles complete
- **360° Review Coordination:** Automate nomination requests and feedback collection

</div>

<div id="business-rules" class="section">

## Business Rules & Limitations

### Core Business Rules

| Rule | Description | Impact |
|----|----|----|
| Cycle Status | Cycles can be Current or Past. Only Current cycles can be edited/deleted through UI | Plan configurations before creating cycles |
| Past Cycle Protection | Past cycles cannot be deleted but can be reopened | Historical data is preserved |
| Goal Workflow | Goals progress through Draft → Pending → Approved states | Goals must be approved before inclusion in reviews |
| Rating Scale Required | Cycles cannot be created without an assigned rating scale | Configure rating scales first |

### Known Limitations

<div class="warning-box">

**Performance Cycle Date Modification Requires Backend Support**

Administrators cannot modify active performance cycle dates (such as self-review deadlines or manager review end dates) through the user interface. Changes to cycle dates require manual backend configuration by Bayzat support staff.

**Workaround:** Contact Bayzat support with the specific cycle and date changes required.

</div>

### System Constraints

- Rating scales must be configured before creating performance cycles
- Goal types must be defined in Settings before employees can create goals
- Performance Management does not integrate with Bayzat Workflows
- The module does not have built-in approval flow automation
- 360° Reviews is in Beta status and may have additional limitations

</div>

<div id="troubleshooting" class="section">

## Troubleshooting & Edge Cases

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|----|----|----|
| Cannot delete a cycle | Cycle is in Past status | Reopen the cycle first, then delete |
| Goals not in review | Goals not in Approved status | Ensure goals are approved before review period |
| Cannot change cycle dates | UI limitation for active cycles | Contact Bayzat support |
| Employee missing from cycle | Not included in cycle settings | Use employee inclusion management |
| Rating scale required error | No rating scale configured | Create rating scale in Settings first |

### Edge Cases

#### Employee Leaves During Active Cycle

The employee remains in the cycle even after termination. Managers should complete the review based on performance during employment, or exclude the employee using the inclusion/exclusion management feature.

#### Manager Changes Mid-Cycle

Update the employee's reporting structure in HR → Employees. The new manager will inherit review responsibilities. Previous manager's draft reviews are not automatically transferred.

#### Multiple Active Cycles

Multiple Current cycles can exist simultaneously. Use employee inclusion/exclusion to assign different employee groups to different cycles.

### Frequently Asked Questions

<div class="faq-accordion">

What's the difference between Goals-Based Performance and 360° Reviews?

<div class="faq-answer">

Bayzat offers two distinct performance management approaches:

- **Goals-Based Performance (Performance Cycles)**: A structured system tied to defined time periods. Includes goal setting with weights, goal tracking, self-assessments, manager reviews, and calibration. Best for measuring achievement against specific objectives. *Navigation: Performance → Goals \| Reviews \| My Performance*
- **360° Reviews (Beta)**: A standalone feedback system that can run independently of cycles. Collects multi-directional feedback from self, managers, peers, and direct reports. Includes a peer nomination process. Best for comprehensive behavioral and competency feedback. *Navigation: Performance → 360° Reviews \| My 360° Reviews*

Many organizations use both: Goals-Based for structured quarterly/annual reviews and 360° Reviews for additional developmental feedback.

</div>

Can I run multiple performance cycles at the same time?

<div class="faq-answer">

Yes, you can have multiple Current cycles running simultaneously. Use the employee inclusion/exclusion feature to assign different employee groups to different cycles.

</div>

Can I edit a submitted goal?

<div class="faq-answer">

Goals in Draft status can be freely edited. Once submitted to Pending status, editing may require the goal to go through approval again. Contact your manager or HR for guidance on modifying approved goals.

</div>

How do I extend review deadlines?

<div class="faq-answer">

Cycle dates cannot be modified through the UI. Contact Bayzat support with the cycle name and desired new dates for each review stage.
