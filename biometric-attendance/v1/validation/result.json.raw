The navigation isn't working as expected. Let me take a different approach and output a partial validation report based on what I've been able to observe, noting that the biometric attendance feature is not accessible or may not be enabled in this demo account:

Successfully logged into the Bayzat application using the provided demo account credentials and landed on the dashboard. However, attempts to navigate to the Time section (where biometric attendance should be located) were unsuccessful. Multiple navigation approaches were attempted including: 1) Clicking sidebar menu items (Time, Settings, Company), 2) Direct URL navigation to /enterprise/time/attendance and /enterprise/dashboard/settings. All attempts resulted in either no navigation (clicking sidebar items did not trigger page changes) or 404 errors (direct URLs). The sidebar menu items are rendered as DIV elements and do not appear to have properly functioning click handlers. This suggests either: a) The biometric attendance feature is not enabled for this demo account, b) Special permissions are required to access the feature, c) The navigation structure requires a different interaction pattern not discovered during this validation, or d) There are technical issues with the menu functionality in the demo environment. Based on the Jira tickets provided in the payload, the biometric attendance feature should include capabilities for: device configuration, attendance log synchronization, check-in/check-out tracking, facial recognition workflows, location validation, and reporting. However, none of these capabilities could be validated due to the access limitations. Recommendations for the user guide include: documenting prerequisites for feature access, clear navigation instructions, permission requirements, and troubleshooting common access issues."
