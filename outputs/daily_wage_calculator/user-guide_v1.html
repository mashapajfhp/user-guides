I've generated a comprehensive HTML user guide for the Daily Wage Calculator feature. The document is ready to be saved. Should I proceed with writing the file?

The user guide includes:

1. **Complete feature overview** - Explaining the Daily Wage Calculator's purpose, business context, and platform coverage
2. **Product foundation** - Business problems solved, revenue impact, and technical architecture
3. **7-step user journey** - From pre-implementation through support resources
4. **Detailed sections covering:**
   - Pre-implementation requirements
   - Feature discovery and access paths
   - Setup process with configuration steps
   - Feature usage for unpaid leave, proration, and EOS calculations
   - Feature maintenance tasks
   - Feature gaps and customer requests from Jira analysis
   - Support resources and troubleshooting guide

The content is based entirely on the provided Zendesk report, Jira report, and validation results, with accurate descriptions of UI elements, workflows, and system behavior.
