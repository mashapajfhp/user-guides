# Workflow Learnings & Feedback

*Last updated: 2026-01-04*

## Common Issues Across All Features

### Navigation Context Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: Every screenshot MUST include the full Bayzat side menu for navigation context
- Users need to see WHERE they are in the application hierarchy
- Screenshots without navigation context are REJECTED

### Screenshot Framing Rules
- Never capture just a dropdown or modal in isolation
- Always show the surrounding UI context
- Include breadcrumbs, page titles, and navigation elements

## Feature-Specific Insights

### Daily Wage Calculator (daily-wage-calculator)

#### CRITICAL: Screenshot Sequence Requirements

**1. Navigation Context (MANDATORY)**
- Every screenshot MUST show the full Bayzat side menu on the left
- The navigation menu provides essential context for users to understand where they are
- Screenshots lacking side menu = REJECTED

**2. Leave Settings Flow - Required Captures**

| Step | Screenshot Requirement | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------------|----------------|
| 1 | Settings > Leaves with full side menu visible | Shows user how to navigate to Leave settings |
| 2 | Leave Policies list (full screen view) | Shows the policies table users will interact with |
| 3 | Click into a specific leave policy | Reveals the Leave Pay rate configuration section |
| 4 | Leave Pay rate section expanded | Shows the configuration options |

**3. Progressive Disclosure Pattern - CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION**

The daily wage calculation feature uses progressive disclosure based on leave type:

| Leave Type | Daily Wage Calculation Visible? | Action Required |
|------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Paid leave** | NO - Not shown | Document that this option does NOT display daily wage calculation |
| **Partially paid leave** | YES - Shows calculation options | Capture the daily wage calculation configuration |
| **Unpaid leave** | YES - Shows calculation options | Capture the daily wage calculation configuration |

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST document this progressive disclosure pattern:
- When "Paid leave" is selected, daily wage calculation fields are HIDDEN
- When "Partially paid leave" OR "Unpaid leave" is selected, daily wage calculation fields APPEAR
- This is intentional UX design, not a bug

**4. Screenshots to EXCLUDE**

| Type | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Dropdown in isolation | Lacks context - no surrounding UI |
| Modal without page context | User can't tell where modal was triggered |
| Table without navigation | User can't locate this table in the app |
| EOS table without context | Needs surrounding settings page visible |

**5. Screenshots to INCLUDE**

| Type | Requirements |
|------|-------------|
| Leave Settings page | Full page with side menu + breadcrumb |
| Leave Policies table | Full view showing all policy rows |
| Leave Policy edit screen | Full modal/page with Leave Pay rate section |
| Leave Pay rate options | Both paid (no calculation) and unpaid (with calculation) states |

- [ ] Leave Policies list captured (not just one row)

## Agent Performance Insights

### Exploration Patterns That Work
1. **Click every configuration option** - Different options reveal different fields
2. **Document what's NOT shown** - Absence of UI elements is valuable information
3. **Follow the progressive disclosure** - Click through all states of toggles/dropdowns

### Common Agent Mistakes to Avoid
1. Taking screenshots of dropdowns without showing where they are
2. Missing the navigation menu in screenshots
3. Only documenting one state of a toggle/dropdown
4. Not clicking into list items to reveal configuration panels
