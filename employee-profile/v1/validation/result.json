Key findings: 12-tab employee profile (About Me, Work, Documents, Dependents, Leaves, Health Insurance, Payroll, Attendance, Timesheet, Assets, Air tickets, Performance), full CRUD operations (Add Employee with bulk import, profile viewing, inline editing, offboarding/deletion), 3 list views (grid, list, org chart), workflow integration with employee triggers, and 40+ approval flow types. Profile completion tracking, search/filter functionality, and configurable column display are all functional. Of 10 WOF issues: 2 confirmed (deletion recovery, profile completion automation), 4 not reproducible, 2 skipped (localization, API-level), and 2 confirmed with workarounds."
