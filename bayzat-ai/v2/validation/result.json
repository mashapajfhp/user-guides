  "summary": "Login to Bayzat application was successful using Playwright automation. However, comprehensive exploration of the Bayzat AI feature was blocked by a persistent onboarding tour modal that prevented all navigation. The tour modal displays 'Step 1 of 4 - Announcements in Home' but does not respond to dismissal attempts via the 'Next' button, Escape key, or JavaScript DOM manipulation. The 'Bayzat AI' text visible in the application header appears to be a company name/logo rather than a navigation element. Based on the sidebar structure, AI features are likely located under the Insights menu, but this could not be verified. Navigation clicks to any sidebar item (Insights, Company, Payroll, etc.) did not result in page changes, suggesting the modal backdrop is capturing all click events. The validation status is 'blocked' rather than 'completed' or 'partial' because no AI-specific functionality could be accessed or tested. Key findings: 1) Login mechanism works correctly with Playwright fill/click methods, 2) Home dashboard structure is visible and well-organized, 3) Persistent UI blocker prevents feature exploration, 4) Bayzat AI feature location could not be confirmed, 5) No CRUD operations, workflows, or approval flows could be tested for this feature. Recommendation: User guide should include clear instructions on accessing AI features and troubleshooting navigation issues caused by onboarding tours.",
