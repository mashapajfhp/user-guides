  "summary": "Validation was blocked at the login stage. Successfully navigated to the Bayzat application login page and documented the login form structure, including email/password fields and alternative login options (Google, Microsoft, magic link). Multiple automated login attempts were made using various JavaScript approaches (direct value assignment, event dispatching, form submission, button clicking), but all failed due to Playwright MCP's evaluate() function consistently returning undefined, preventing confirmation of successful form interaction. This technical issue completely blocked access to the Bayzat AI feature and all subsequent validation tasks. The login page itself appears functional with proper UI elements visible and accessible. Key observation: The page displays 'You need to enable JavaScript to run this app' message, though JavaScript is executing to some degree. Four screenshots were captured documenting the login attempts. No features within the Bayzat AI module could be explored due to this authentication blocker. Recommendation: Resolve the Playwright MCP evaluate() result handling issue or use alternative authentication method to proceed with feature validation.",
