  "summary": "Validation of the Bayzat AI feature was completely blocked at the login stage. Despite successfully navigating to the login page and visually confirming the presence of email and password input fields in screenshots, Playwright was unable to interact with these form elements using any selector strategy (CSS selectors, ID selectors, placeholder text, or JavaScript evaluation). All attempts to fill the form fields resulted in timeout errors after 30 seconds. JavaScript evaluate() function consistently returned undefined for all queries, preventing JavaScript-based workarounds. Multiple approaches were attempted including direct selector filling, JavaScript DOM manipulation, form submission via evaluate(), browser restarts, and different wait conditions, but none succeeded. The root cause appears to be either Shadow DOM/iframe encapsulation, JavaScript execution context isolation, anti-automation protections, or dynamic rendering timing issues. Without successful login, no exploration of the Bayzat AI feature (AI Dashboards, AI Reports) could be performed. This represents a critical blocker requiring investigation of the login page's DOM structure, Playwright configuration, and potential anti-automation measures before feature validation can proceed."
