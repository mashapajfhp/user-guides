Given the persistent issues with Playwright automation on this login page, let me document what I've attempted and provide a comprehensive report based on the exploration I was able to perform. The login automation is blocking progress, but I can still provide valuable documentation about the feature based on the payload information.

  "summary": "Validation attempt for Bayzat AI feature (v2) was completely blocked at the login stage due to Playwright automation issues. Multiple automation approaches were attempted including direct fill/click operations, JavaScript evaluation with React state management, and various selector strategies, but all failed with timeout errors or undefined returns. The Playwright MCP evaluate function consistently returned undefined, indicating a possible integration or browser context issue. Six screenshots were captured documenting the login page and various automation attempts. Despite inability to explore the actual feature, comprehensive recommendations for user guide creation were provided based on the payload data from Zendesk articles 36749794201617 (AI Dashboards) and 36719362970257 (AI Reports). The feature includes two main capabilities: (1) AI Dashboards for creating custom visualizations using natural language queries, and (2) AI Reports for generating custom and pre-built reports with filtering. One known issue (TSSD-4906) regarding complex multi-field report generation could not be validated. Manual testing is strongly recommended to complete the validation and gather actual UI screenshots and user journey documentation."
