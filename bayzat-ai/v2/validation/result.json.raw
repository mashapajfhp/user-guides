Since I'm unable to successfully log in through the standard login form, let me document the blocker and provide a partial validation result with the information I've gathered:

  "summary": "Validation was blocked at the login stage. Successfully navigated to the Bayzat application login page and documented the login form structure, including email/password fields and alternative login options (Google, Microsoft, magic link). Multiple automated login attempts were made using various JavaScript approaches (direct value assignment, event dispatching, form submission, button clicking), but all failed due to Playwright MCP's evaluate() function consistently returning undefined, preventing confirmation of successful form interaction. This technical issue completely blocked access to the Bayzat AI feature and all subsequent validation tasks. The login page itself appears functional with proper UI elements visible and accessible. Key observation: The page displays 'You need to enable JavaScript to run this app' message, though JavaScript is executing to some degree. Four screenshots were captured documenting the login attempts. No features within the Bayzat AI module could be explored due to this authentication blocker. Recommendation: Resolve the Playwright MCP evaluate() result handling issue or use alternative authentication method to proceed with feature validation."
}
```

**Summary:**

The validation was **blocked at the login stage**. I was unable to successfully authenticate and access the Bayzat AI feature due to technical limitations with the Playwright MCP server. The JavaScript `evaluate()` function consistently returned `undefined` for all script executions, preventing me from confirming whether form fields were filled or submission was successful.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Successfully loaded the login page
- ✅ Identified all login form elements (email, password, buttons)
- ❌ Unable to complete login - form submission did not trigger navigation
- ❌ All feature exploration tasks blocked by authentication failure
- ❌ Zero access to Bayzat AI Dashboards or AI Reports functionality

**Screenshots Captured:** 4 screenshots documenting the login attempts

**Next Steps Needed:**
1. Resolve Playwright MCP evaluate() result handling issue
2. Consider alternative authentication methods (API-based session creation)
3. Retry validation once login blocker is resolved
