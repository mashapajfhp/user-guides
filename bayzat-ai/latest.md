## Setup Process

<div class="content">

Bayzat AI is designed to work immediately upon access with minimal configuration required. The AI leverages existing data from connected modules, eliminating the need for extensive setup. However, understanding the initial configuration options ensures optimal use of the feature.

### Prerequisites Verification

Before using Bayzat AI, verify the following prerequisites are met:

1.  **Data Availability:** Ensure data exists in connected modules (Leave Management, Attendance, Employee Records, Payroll, etc.)
2.  **User Permissions:** Confirm your user role has access to AI features and the data modules you wish to query
3.  **Browser Compatibility:** Use a modern browser with JavaScript enabled (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

<div class="info-box">

**Note:** Bayzat AI requires JavaScript to be enabled in your browser. If you see a message stating "You need to enable JavaScript to run this app," check your browser settings.

</div>

### First-Time Configuration Steps

#### Step 1: Access Pre-built Dashboard

Navigate to AI Dashboards from the dashboard menu. The system automatically displays a pre-built HR dashboard with example insights. This serves as your configuration template.

#### Step 2: Review Available Data Categories

Examine the pre-built dashboard to understand which data categories are available for querying:

- Leave management data
- Attendance tracking data
- Employee records
- Payroll information

<div class="info-box">

**Beta Note:** Bayzat AI Reports is currently in beta. Additional data categories will be added as the feature evolves.

</div>

#### Step 3: Test Natural Language Queries

Navigate to AI Reports and test the query input bar with a simple question to verify data connectivity:

1.  Enter a basic query such as "Show me total employee count"
2.  Click "Generate Report"
3.  Verify the AI returns accurate data from your system

#### Step 4: Configure First Custom Dashboard

Create your first custom dashboard tile to establish your preferred visualization settings:

1.  Click "New Dashboard" in the AI Dashboards section
2.  Enter a natural language query for a metric you monitor regularly
3.  Select your preferred visualization format when prompted
4.  Save the dashboard tile
5.  Verify the tile displays correctly and refreshes as expected

### Recommended Default Settings

| Setting | Recommended Value | Rationale |
|----|----|----|
| Dashboard Refresh | Weekly (automatic) | Balances data currency with system performance |
| Query Specificity | Include date ranges and filters | Improves accuracy and relevance of results |
| Visualization Format | Auto-select (AI determines best format) | Leverages AI intelligence for optimal data presentation |
| Report Output | Table format for data export | Provides maximum flexibility for further analysis |

### Verification Steps

After completing initial setup, verify the configuration is working correctly:

#### Dashboard Verification

1.  Confirm pre-built dashboard displays data from your organization
2.  Verify custom dashboard tiles show current data
3.  Test dashboard search functionality to locate saved dashboards
4.  Confirm dashboard tiles can be renamed, rearranged, and deleted

#### Reports Verification

1.  Generate a pre-built report and verify data accuracy
2.  Create a custom query and confirm the AI interprets it correctly
3.  Apply filters (date range, department, employee) and verify they affect results
4.  Download a report to confirm export functionality works

### Common Setup Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|----|----|----|
| No data appears in dashboard | Insufficient data in connected modules | Ensure employee records, leave, attendance, or payroll data exists in the system |
| Query returns no results | Query too vague or references unavailable data | Add specific date ranges, departments, or employee filters to narrow the query |
| Cannot create new dashboard | Permission restrictions | Verify your user role has access to AI Dashboard creation features |
| JavaScript error message | Browser JavaScript disabled | Enable JavaScript in browser settings and refresh the page |

### Post-Setup Best Practices

- **Start Simple:** Begin with basic queries and gradually increase complexity as you learn the AI's interpretation patterns
- **Use Filters:** Always include date ranges and department filters for more accurate results
- **Save Frequently Used Queries:** Convert recurring report queries into dashboard tiles for quick access
- **Review Pre-built Options:** Check pre-built reports regularly as new templates are added during the beta phase
- **Provide Feedback:** As a beta feature, user feedback helps improve AI accuracy and functionality

<div class="warning-box">

**⚠️ Known Configuration Limitation**

**Impact:** The AI report builder cannot generate complex, multi-field reports that aggregate data across different platform modules such as Payroll and Leave Management.

**Workaround:** Users must manually compile reports by extracting data separately from multiple sources.

</div>

</div>

<div id="workflow-integration" class="section section">

## Workflow Integration

<div class="content">

<div class="info-box">

**Note:** Bayzat AI does not currently have dedicated workflow triggers or actions in the Bayzat Workflows system. The feature operates independently as a reporting and analytics tool.

</div>

### Potential Workflow Scenarios

While Bayzat AI doesn't integrate directly with Bayzat Workflows at this time, there are potential scenarios where workflow automation could enhance AI-powered reporting in the future:

#### Scenario 1: Automated Dashboard Refresh Notifications

**Potential Benefit:** HR teams could receive automated notifications when critical dashboard metrics exceed defined thresholds, enabling proactive management of HR issues.

**Example Use Case:** When the AI dashboard detects that leave balance utilization drops below 50% company-wide, trigger a workflow to notify the HR manager to review leave policies or encourage employees to take time off.

#### Scenario 2: Scheduled Report Generation and Distribution

**Potential Benefit:** Automate the generation and distribution of recurring AI reports to stakeholders, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistent reporting cadence.

**Example Use Case:** Every Monday morning, automatically generate a weekly attendance report for each department head and send it via email, allowing managers to review team attendance patterns without manual report creation.

#### Scenario 3: Data-Driven Approval Workflows

**Potential Benefit:** Use AI-generated insights to inform approval decisions in other Bayzat modules, creating intelligent, data-driven workflows.

**Example Use Case:** When an employee submits a leave request, trigger a workflow that checks the AI-generated department leave coverage report. If coverage falls below a threshold, route the request to a senior manager for additional approval.

#### Scenario 4: Anomaly Detection Alerts

**Potential Benefit:** Automatically alert teams when AI reports detect unusual patterns or anomalies in company data, enabling rapid response to potential issues.

**Example Use Case:** If the AI detects a sudden spike in leave requests within a specific department (e.g., 30% increase over the previous month), trigger a workflow to notify the department head and HR business partner to investigate potential team issues.

### Current Workaround for Workflow-Like Automation

Until direct workflow integration is available, consider these manual processes:

1.  **Schedule Regular Dashboard Reviews:** Set calendar reminders to review AI dashboards weekly or monthly
2.  **Export and Share Reports:** Download AI reports and manually distribute them to stakeholders via email or collaboration tools
3.  **Create Report Templates:** Save frequently used AI report queries for quick regeneration
4.  **Combine with Other Tools:** Use AI report data as input for decision-making in other Bayzat workflows (e.g., reviewing attendance reports before approving shift changes)

**Future Enhancement:** As Bayzat AI evolves from beta to full release, workflow integration capabilities may be added. Check the Bayzat release notes for updates on workflow triggers and actions related to AI reporting.

## Business Rules & Limitations

<div class="content">

### Core Business Rules

| Rule | Description |
|----|----|
| Data Access | Users can only query data from modules they have permission to access |
| Dashboard Refresh | AI Dashboards refresh automatically on a weekly basis; manual refresh available |
| Report Generation | AI Reports pull real-time data at the time of generation |
| Query Specificity | Detailed queries with date ranges and filters produce more accurate results |
| Beta Status | AI Reporting is in beta; interface and capabilities may change with updates |

### System Constraints

- **Cross-module Reports:** Cannot generate reports combining data from multiple modules (e.g., Payroll + Leave). Generate separate reports and compile manually.
- **Module Coverage:** Limited to leave management, attendance, employee records, and payroll. More modules coming in future releases.
- **Query Interpretation:** Vague queries may produce incomplete results. Be specific with date ranges, departments, and output format.
- **Desktop Optimized:** Best experience on desktop browsers; mobile access available but limited for complex visualizations.

## Troubleshooting & Edge Cases

<div class="content">

### Common Issues

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|----|----|----|
| Report returns incomplete data | Query is too vague | Add specific date ranges, departments, or employee filters to your query |
| Cannot generate cross-module report | System limitation (TSSD-4906) | Generate separate reports for each module and compile manually |
| Dashboard shows outdated data | Waiting for weekly refresh | Click the refresh button to manually update data |
| Cannot find saved dashboard | Search term doesn't match | Use keywords from the dashboard name in search |
| Cannot access AI features | Permission or subscription issue | Contact your system administrator to verify access |

### Known Limitations

- **Cross-module Aggregation:** Cannot combine data from Payroll and Leave Management in a single report
- **Pre-built Dashboard Tiles:** Default HR dashboard tiles may be view-only and cannot be deleted
- **AI Reporting Beta Status:** Interface may change as improvements are implemented

### Edge Cases

- **Incomplete Data Sets:** Reports for new employees or departments may return limited results. Adjust date ranges to periods where data exists.
- **Special Characters:** Avoid special symbols in queries. Use "employees in Sales" instead of "employees in Sales/Marketing & Support".
- **Large Data Sets:** Reports covering extensive date ranges may take longer to generate. Break into smaller, focused queries.
