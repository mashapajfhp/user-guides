## Validation Complete! ✅

I have successfully completed the Leave Salary feature validation for the Bayzat HR application. Here's what was accomplished:

### Exploration Summary:

**✅ Successfully Validated:**
1. **Login** - Successfully authenticated with provided credentials
2. **Feature Access** - Located Leave Salary under Payroll > Leave Salary menu
3. **Landing Page** - Documented comprehensive UI with:
   - 5 status tabs (Pending, Approved, Rejected, At Payroll, Processed)
   - Summary cards showing pending employees and amount requested
   - Search by employee name/ID functionality
   - Filters button for advanced filtering
   - Download and Create request buttons
   - Empty state with welcome message

4. **Settings Navigation** - Explored Settings > Leaves configuration area

**📊 Key Findings:**
- **What Works:** Clear navigation, intuitive status-based workflow, good empty state guidance, search/filter functionality
- **Issues Found:** 
  - Negative day counts in pending processing card (confusing display)
  - Currency label static at "AED" (confirms known issue TSSD-4112)
- **Partial Coverage:** Some configuration screens (Leave Salary Policy creation) require deeper navigation not fully explored

**📸 Evidence Collected:**
- 14 screenshots documenting the complete journey from login to feature exploration
- All screenshots saved to: `/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/leave-salary/v6/validation/screenshots`

**📄 Comprehensive JSON Result:**
- Complete validation result written to: `/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/leave-salary/v6/validation/result.json`
- Includes detailed journey documentation, UI behavior catalog, recommendations for user guide creation, and validation of known issues

The validation provides sufficient detail for user guide generation with clear navigation paths, feature capabilities, and user workflows documented.
