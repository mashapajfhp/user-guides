    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system functionality designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary by the number of actual working days in a month. The calculator accommodates different leave policies, allowing organizations to use either calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the basis for calculation. A key sophistication of this system is its ability to automatically account for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to ensure accurate salary reduction. By integrating with payroll systems, the calculator generates automatic deductions that reflect approved unpaid leave, supporting HR personnel in maintaining precise and fair compensation management. This feature helps organizations standardize leave-related salary calculations, reduce manual processing errors, and provide transparency in how unpaid leave impacts employee compensation. The daily wage calculator is an advanced payroll management tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. It enables payroll professionals to determine daily wage rates using multiple calculation bases, including calendar days, working days, and custom days. The tool addresses complex salary computation scenarios such as salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. By offering granular control over calculation parameters, the system allows companies to align wage calculations with specific organizational policies and regional labor regulations. Users can select which salary components to include, such as basic salary, allowances, or combinations thereof, ensuring accurate and compliant wage computations. The calculator supports customization for different business contexts, particularly in regions like UAE and KSA where labor laws have specific monthly wage calculation requirements. This feature represents a significant improvement over traditional limited wage calculation methods, providing payroll managers with enhanced flexibility and precision in compensation management. The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management tool that enables super administrators to proportionally adjust employee salaries based on actual days worked. It provides flexible calculation methods for prorating salaries during an employee's first month of work or end-of-service settlement. The feature allows administrators to choose between different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days, ensuring precise and adaptable salary computations. By offering granular control over salary calculations, the tool helps organizations accurately compensate employees for partial work periods. The system ensures that salary adjustments can be made systematically, with changes automatically applied to active, unpaid payroll amounts. This functionality is critical for maintaining payroll accuracy and supporting fair compensation practices across varying employment scenarios.",
