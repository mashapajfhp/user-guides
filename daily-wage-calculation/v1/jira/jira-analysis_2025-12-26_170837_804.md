- **Monthly Accrual Policy**: Leave policy where employees earn leave days only at the end of each completed month, not prorated for partial months. [Tickets: TSSD-4742]
- **Conditional Accrual Policy**: Leave policy where employees earn leave days daily instead of waiting until month-end, allowing more flexible leave balance tracking. [Tickets: TSSD-4742]
- **Service Duration**: Total number of working days an employee has worked, calculated by dividing total days by 365, with special consideration for leap years and including the departure date [Tickets: TSSD-1625]
- **Gratuity Calculation**: End of service benefit calculation that uses different rates for service periods (21 days per year for first 5 years, 30 days per year for subsequent years), with special handling for partial years and leap years. [Tickets: TSSD-2252, TSSD-2043]
- **Daily Rate Divisor**: The number of days used to divide the monthly salary when calculating daily wage, which can be configured in the leave policy and may differ from the actual calendar days in a month. [Tickets: TSSD-4731, TSSD-1807]
