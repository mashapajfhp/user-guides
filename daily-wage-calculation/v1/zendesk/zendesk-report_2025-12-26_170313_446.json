    "description": "Daily wage calculation is a payroll feature that automatically deducts unpaid leave from an employee's salary by computing a daily pay rate. The daily pay is calculated by dividing the total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. Public holidays are subtracted from the working days count to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation. The feature supports both calendar days (e.g., 30 days) and working days (e.g., 22 days) leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, an automatic pay deduction is created and reflected on the payroll table."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculation\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-26\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nDaily wage calculation is a payroll feature that automatically deducts unpaid leave from an employee's salary by computing a daily pay rate. The daily pay is calculated by dividing the total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. Public holidays are subtracted from the working days count to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation. The feature supports both calendar days (e.g., 30 days) and working days (e.g., 22 days) leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, an automatic pay deduction is created and reflected on the payroll table.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, replacing limited previous options for calculating daily rates. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- To adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Primary Personas\n- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave and salary calculations. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Superadmin, Payroll table managers, and transaction processors who configure and manage daily wage calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admin users who manage payroll configuration and salary proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Navigation Paths\n- Access the daily wage calculation feature through the payroll table where automatic pay deductions are reflected following unpaid leave request approval. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation to access the salary proration configuration interface. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Prerequisites\n- An unpaid leave request must be submitted and approved before the daily wage calculation and associated pay deduction are generated. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to properly exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admin role is required to access and modify salary proration settings. Access to the Payroll module must be available. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Required Inputs\n- Employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days or calendar days in the month based on the leave policy, and public holidays falling within the calculation month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only). [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Selection of calculation basis is required: custom days, calendar days, or working days. These options determine how the daily wage is calculated for salary proration. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Expected Outputs\n- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, calculated daily pay rate, and the deduction reflected on the payroll table. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method. Changes affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Procedures\n- Receive and approve unpaid leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary amount by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Navigate to Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), choose salary components to include in the calculation, and apply the configuration. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- 1. Go to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to determine actual working days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days (all days in a month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible configuration per company policy). Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with local labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new salary proration changes. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a 22-day working month, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation results vary depending on month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February) when using calendar days, and different calculation methods can significantly impact final wage calculations for salary proration and leave encashment. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must manually reject those transactions before saving new salary proration settings to ensure the changes take effect correctly. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculation feature interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and integrates with leave management and employee record systems to process unpaid leave requests. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- The Daily Wage Calculation feature impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction, and interacts with the company's public holiday calendar configuration. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Daily wage calculation interacts with the Payroll system and the Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) module. It directly affects payroll table transactions and employee salary calculations for first salary and end-of-service settlements. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Glossary Terms\n- Daily pay: The calculated daily salary rate used for deducting unpaid leave, derived by dividing total salary by actual working days.
