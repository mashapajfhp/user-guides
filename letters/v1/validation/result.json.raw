## Validation Summary

**Status:** ❌ BLOCKED at Login

I attempted to validate the Letters feature in the Bayzat HR application but encountered a critical blocker: **the automated login process failed**.

### What Happened

1. **Browser Setup:** Successfully navigated to https://app.bayzat.com/ with proper viewport (1280x900)
2. **Login Attempts:** Made multiple sophisticated attempts to login using:
   - Direct JavaScript value assignment
   - Event dispatching (input, change, blur events)
   - Simulated keyboard events (keydown, keypress, keyup)
   - Character-by-character typing simulation
3. **Result:** The React-based login form did not respond to any programmatic input methods

### Technical Issue

The Bayzat application's login form appears to have **client-side validation that blocks programmatic input**. This is likely due to:
- React's synthetic event system requiring trusted user events
- Form validation checking for `isTrusted` event properties
- Possible anti-automation protections

### Artifacts Generated

✅ **6 screenshots** captured and saved to: `letters/v1/validation/screenshots/`
✅ **Complete validation result JSON** saved to: `letters/v1/validation/result.json`

### Recommendations

To successfully validate the Letters feature, one of these approaches would be needed:

1. **Use Playwright's native methods** instead of JavaScript evaluation (e.g., `page.fill()`, `page.click()`)
2. **Pre-authenticate with saved cookies** or browser context
3. **Use Playwright codegen** to record a manual login flow
4. **API-based authentication** to obtain session tokens
5. **Manual validation** by a human tester

The validation result JSON contains complete documentation of the login attempts and provides a foundation for retry with an alternative approach.
