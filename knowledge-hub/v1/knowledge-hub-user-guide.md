### How Knowledge Hub Fits

Knowledge Hub is Bayzat's **centralized knowledge management platform** that organizes company information into a hierarchical structure of Spaces, Folders, and Pages. It replaces scattered documents with an AI-powered, searchable content system.

<div class="info-box">

**Mental model:** Create Spaces (top-level categories) → Add Folders (sub-categories) → Create Pages (rich-text documents) → Configure permissions → Share via links or Newsfeed → Employees search with AI or browse structure.

</div>

Properly organized knowledge hubs ensure employees find answers instantly rather than searching through emails or asking colleagues.

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Key Decisions Before Setup

Answer these questions before creating content:

- **What content categories do you need?** — Plan Spaces for major knowledge areas (Policies, Procedures, Departments)
- **Who needs access to what?** — Configure permissions at Space, Folder, or Page level
- **How will content be maintained?** — Assign Knowledge Hub Managers and Editors
- **How will you share updates?** — Decide between direct links and Newsfeed announcements

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Related Features

- **Bayzat AI** — Integrated chatbot for intelligent search across knowledge base content
- **Newsfeed** — Share spaces, folders, and pages directly to company announcements
- **Bayzat Workflows** — Automate actions based on Knowledge Hub events
- **User Management** — Leverages employee directory for permission assignment

</div>

### Example Workflow: New Space Notification

<div class="feature-card">

|             |                                    |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| **Trigger** | Space created                      |
| **Action**  | Send email notification to HR team |

*Result: HR stays informed of new content areas being created across the organization.*

</div>

<div class="info-box">

<div id="business-rules-limitations" class="section section">

## Business Rules & Limitations

### Core Business Rules

| Rule | Description | Impact |
|----|----|----|
| Permission inheritance | Folder and page permissions inherit from parent Space | Set permissions at Space level for consistent access |
| Admin override | Super Admins and KH Managers have full access to all Spaces | Cannot restrict admin access to any content |
| File size limit | Maximum 15 MB per file upload | Large files must be compressed or split |
| Trash retention | Deleted items kept for 30 days | Recovery possible within retention period |

### System Constraints

- Cross-links between documents can only be created on web (viewable on mobile)
- AI chatbot requires content to be indexed before searchable
- Mobile app syncs content but has limited editing capabilities

</div>

<div id="troubleshooting-edge-cases" class="section section">

## Troubleshooting & Edge Cases

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|----|----|----|
| Cannot see Knowledge Hub | Feature not enabled or no permissions | Contact administrator to enable access |
| Cannot create Space | User lacks Editor role or higher | Request Editor permissions from admin |
| File upload fails | File exceeds 15 MB limit | Compress file or split into smaller parts |
| Content not in AI search | Recently added content not indexed | Wait for indexing to complete (usually minutes) |
| Cannot change admin permissions | Super Admins always have full access | This is by design and cannot be changed |

### Deleted Content Recovery

<div class="info-box">

**30-Day Trash Retention:** Deleted Spaces, folders, and pages are moved to Trash and kept for 30 days. Access Trash from the Knowledge Hub menu to restore accidentally deleted content.
