Direct navigation to multiple URL patterns (/performance, /performance/360-reviews, /performance/reviews/360, /settings) all resulted in 404 errors. This indicates the Performance module is not enabled or provisioned for the demo account (job+demoacct@bayzat.com).

Login and basic dashboard access work correctly.
