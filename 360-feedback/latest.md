## What is 360° Reviews?

### Overview

360° Reviews is a comprehensive performance feedback system within Bayzat that enables organizations to collect multi-directional feedback about employees. Unlike traditional top-down performance reviews, 360° feedback gathers input from peers, direct reports, managers, and the employee themselves to provide a complete view of performance and development areas.

### Key Benefits

- Gather feedback from multiple perspectives for holistic performance insights
- Structured workflow ensures consistent feedback collection with clear timelines
- Employees nominate their own peers who work closely with them
- Customize feedback categories, questions, and rating scales to align with organizational values
- Real-time visibility into nomination status and survey completion

### Who Uses This Feature?

| User Role | What They Do | Value Proposition |
|----|----|----|
| **HR Administrators** | Create and manage 360° review cycles, configure feedback categories, and generate reports | Reduce feedback cycle coordination from weeks to days while ensuring every employee receives structured, unbiased developmental insights—eliminating spreadsheet chaos and manual follow-ups |
| **Performance Managers** | Oversee review cycles for their teams and access aggregated feedback reports | Make confident promotion, coaching, and development decisions backed by multi-perspective evidence rather than relying on single-source observations or gut instinct |
| **Employees** | Nominate peers for feedback, complete self-assessments, and view their feedback reports | Uncover blind spots and validate strengths through honest peer perspectives, giving you a clear roadmap for career growth that self-reflection alone cannot provide |
| **Peer Reviewers** | Provide confidential feedback on colleagues who nominated them | Help colleagues grow through honest, constructive observations in a safe, confidential format—contributing to team development without risking working relationships |

### How 360° Feedback Fits

360° Reviews is a **multi-directional feedback system** within Bayzat's Performance suite that collects input from peers, managers, and direct reports. Each review cycle progresses through nomination, feedback collection, and report generation phases.

<div class="info-box">

**Mental model:** Admin creates cycle → Employees nominate peers → Nominated peers provide feedback → System aggregates responses → Reports generated for holistic performance insights.

</div>

Properly configured 360° reviews provide comprehensive developmental insights that self-reflection or single-source evaluations cannot achieve.

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Key Decisions Before Setup

Answer these questions before creating a review cycle:

- **What competencies will you evaluate?** — Configure feedback categories (Technical Expertise, Leadership, Communication, Teamwork)
- **How many peers can employees nominate?** — Set nomination limits based on desired feedback breadth
- **What is the review timeline?** — Define nomination, feedback, and finalization periods
- **What rating scale will you use?** — Configure 3-10 point scales in Performance settings

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Related Features

- **Performance Reviews** — Standard review module that can incorporate 360° feedback results
- **Notifications** — System alerts for review invitations, nomination reminders, and deadlines
- **Employee Directory** — Source for participant selection and profile information
- **Organization Chart** — Defines reporting relationships for peer nomination eligibility

</div>

<div class="subsection">

### Prerequisites & Requirements

| Requirement | Description | Status |
|----|----|----|
| Performance Module | 360° Reviews is part of the Performance management suite | Required |
| Employee Data | Employee profiles must exist with accurate reporting structures | Required |
| Feedback Categories | Define competency categories in Settings \> Performance \> 360° feedback | Required |

### Decision Points in the Process

Administrators make several key decisions that shape the review experience:

| Decision Point | Options | Impact |
|----|----|----|
| Review Timeline | Duration for each phase (nomination, feedback, finalization) | Determines how much time participants have at each stage |
| Participant Selection | Which employees to include in the cycle | Defines scope and scale of the review |
| Nomination Settings | Number of peers, nomination criteria | Influences breadth and diversity of feedback |
| Survey Configuration | Question selection from question bank, feedback categories | Shapes the type and depth of feedback collected |

### Expected Outcomes at Each Stage

Each phase produces specific deliverables and status changes:

- **After Creation:** Review appears in list with "Pending Peer Nominations" status, participants receive invitation emails
- **After Nominations:** Peer reviewer list is finalized, status updates to reflect nomination completion
- **After Survey Creation:** Feedback surveys are configured for each participant group (Self, Manager, Peer, Direct Reports), surveys show "Ready" status in Surveys tab
- **After Feedback Collection:** Survey responses are captured in system, completion metrics are updated
- **After Finalization:** 360° reports are generated, review status changes to "Completed"

### Typical Use Case Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Quarterly Performance Reviews

An organization runs 360° feedback cycles quarterly for all team leads and managers. The admin creates a review cycle named "Q1 2024 Leadership Review" with a 2-week nomination period, 3-week feedback period, and 1-week finalization period. Participants nominate 5-7 peers, and feedback focuses on leadership competencies from the question bank.

#### Scenario 2: Annual Comprehensive Assessment

For annual reviews, the admin launches a company-wide 360° cycle covering all employees. The timeline extends to 3 weeks for nominations and 4 weeks for feedback collection to accommodate the larger participant pool. The survey includes questions across all feedback categories: Technical Expertise, Leadership & Influence, Values & Culture Fit, Flexibility and Adaptability, Reliability and Dependability, Communication Skills, and Teamwork and Collaboration.

#### Scenario 3: New Manager Onboarding

When promoting employees to management roles, the admin creates targeted 360° reviews for new managers after their first 90 days. The review focuses on early leadership indicators and helps identify development areas. A shorter timeline (1 week nomination, 2 weeks feedback) keeps the process agile.

<div class="info-box">

**Best Practice:** Monitor the "Overview" dashboard regularly during active review cycles. The cards showing "Active reviews," "Employees involved," "Pending peer nominations," and "Upcoming deadlines" provide at-a-glance status to keep cycles on track.

</div>

<div id="setup-process" class="section section">

## Initial Setup

Before launching your first 360° review cycle, complete the initial system configuration to ensure smooth operation and meaningful feedback collection.

### Prerequisites Checklist

Verify these items are in place before setup:

- Admin access to Performance module
- Employee records populated in Bayzat HR
- Clear understanding of your review objectives and timeline
- Defined feedback competencies relevant to your organization

### Step 1: Configure Feedback Categories

Feedback categories organize the competencies you'll assess in 360° reviews.

1.  Navigate to **Settings** → **Performance** → **360° feedback**
2.  Select the **Feedback categories** tab
3.  Review the default categories provided:
    - Technical Expertise
    - Leadership & Influence
    - Values & Culture Fit
    - Flexibility and Adaptability
    - Reliability and Dependability
    - Communication Skills
    - Teamwork and Collaboration
4.  Customize categories to align with your organization's competency framework
5.  Save your configuration

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/settings-02-feedback-categories.png" class="screenshot" alt="360° feedback settings with feedback categories and question bank" />
<figcaption>Configuring feedback categories in settings</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="info-box">

**Recommendation:** Start with 4-6 core categories for your first review cycle. You can expand as you gain experience with the 360° process.

</div>

### Step 2: Build Your Question Bank

The Question Bank is a centralized repository where you create and store all the feedback questions used in 360° review surveys. Questions are organized by feedback category, allowing you to build a reusable library of questions that can be selected when creating surveys for different review cycles.

1.  In the 360° feedback settings, select the **Question bank** tab
2.  Create questions aligned to each feedback category
3.  Write clear, behavioral questions that prompt specific examples
4.  Consider using a mix of rating scales and open-ended questions
5.  Save questions to the bank for reuse across review cycles

<div class="info-box">

**Best Practice:** Effective 360° questions focus on observable behaviors rather than personality traits. For example: "How effectively does this person communicate project updates to stakeholders?" rather than "Is this person a good communicator?"

</div>

### Step 3: Verify Employee Data

Ensure employee information is current and complete:

1.  Navigate to **HR** → **Employees**
2.  Verify that all employees who will participate in 360° reviews have:
    - Active employment status
    - Correct reporting relationships
    - Valid email addresses
    - Appropriate role/department assignments
3.  Update any outdated information before launching reviews

### Step 4: Plan Your First Review Cycle

Before creating your first review, document your plan:

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Nomination Criteria</strong></td>
<td>How many peers should each participant nominate? (typically 3-7)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Communication</strong></td>
<td>Prepare announcement and instructions for participants</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

- **Nomination Period:** 2 weeks
- **Feedback Submission Period:** 3 weeks
- **Review Finalization Period:** 1 week
- **Peer Nominations:** 5-7 peers per participant
- **Feedback Categories:** 4-5 core competencies
- **Questions per Category:** 2-3 questions

The Surveys tab displays all participant groups that need survey configuration:

1.  Navigate to the review detail page by clicking the review name
2.  Click the **Surveys** tab
3.  You'll see survey cards for each participant group showing their readiness status

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/surveys-01-surveys-tab-overview.png" class="screenshot" alt="Surveys tab showing participant groups" />
<figcaption>Surveys tab showing participant groups (Employee Self Review, Manager Review, Peer Reviewers) with "Create survey" buttons and bulk "Create all surveys" option</figcaption>
</figure>

Each participant group card shows:

- **Group name:** Employee Self Review, Manager Review, Direct Reports Review, or Peer Reviewers
- **Status:** Whether a survey has been created for this group
- **Create survey button:** To create an individual survey for that group

At the top of the tab, you'll find the **Create all surveys** button to bulk-create surveys for all groups at once.

##### Survey Types

Each review cycle includes four survey types:

- **Self Review:** Sent to employees to reflect on their own contributions and development
- **Manager Review:** Sent to the employee's direct manager for performance feedback and development insights
- **Direct Reports Review:** Sent to employee's direct reports to capture leadership and coaching impact
- **Peer Review:** Sent to nominated peers who work closely with the employee to capture collaboration and team impact

##### Survey Creation Modes

When creating a survey (either individually or in bulk), you'll be presented with two creation modes:

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/surveys-02-create-survey-mode-selection.png" class="screenshot" alt="Survey creation mode selection dialog" />
<figcaption>Choose between "Blank Survey" (build from scratch) or "Start with AI" (let Bayzat AI generate questions)</figcaption>
</figure>

1.  **Blank Survey:** Build your survey from scratch by selecting questions from the Question Bank or creating custom questions
2.  **Start with AI:** Let Bayzat AI generate role-specific survey questions based on your requirements

##### Option 1: Creating a Blank Survey

When you select "Blank Survey" and click Continue:

<figcaption>Blank survey creation interface with "Explore questions bank" and "Add question" options</figcaption>
</figure>

The blank survey interface provides two ways to add questions:

- **Explore questions bank:** Browse and select from pre-built questions organized by category
- **Add question:** Create custom questions from scratch

###### Using the Question Bank

Click "Explore questions bank" to open the Question Bank dialog:

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/surveys-04-question-bank-categories.png" class="screenshot" alt="Question Bank dialog with feedback categories" />
<figcaption>Question Bank organized by 8 feedback categories - click any category to expand and view available questions</figcaption>
</figure>

The Question Bank includes questions organized by feedback categories:

- Problem Solving Skills
- Technical Expertise
- Leadership & Influence
- Values & Culture Fit
- Flexibility and Adaptability
- Reliability and Dependability
- Communication Skills
- Teamwork and Collaboration

Click on any category to expand it and see the available questions:

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/surveys-05-question-bank-expanded.png" class="screenshot" alt="Expanded category showing individual questions" />
<figcaption>Expanded "Leadership &amp; Influence" category showing individual questions with checkboxes for selection</figcaption>
</figure>

Select the questions you want to include by checking the boxes, then click "Add selected" to add them to your survey.

##### Option 2: Creating with AI

When you select "Start with AI" and click Continue:

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/surveys-06-ai-option-selected.png" class="screenshot" alt="AI option selected in mode dialog" />
<figcaption>Selecting the "Start with AI" option to let Bayzat AI generate survey questions</figcaption>
</figure>

The AI generation interface opens with the following configuration options:

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/surveys-07-ai-generation-interface.png" class="screenshot" alt="AI survey generation interface" />
<figcaption>AI survey generation form with prompt input, category selection, and question count configuration</figcaption>
</figure>

Configure the AI generation with:

- **Prompt:** Describe the role or context for which questions should be generated (e.g., "Generate questions for evaluating a software engineer's technical skills and collaboration")
- **Category selection:** Choose which feedback categories to include in the generated questions
- **Number of questions:** Specify how many questions you want AI to generate

Click "Generate" to have Bayzat AI create role-specific questions based on your input. You can review and edit the generated questions before saving.

##### Bulk Creating Surveys

To create surveys for all participant groups at once, click the **Create all surveys** button at the top of the Surveys tab:

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/surveys-08-bulk-create-mode-selection.png" class="screenshot" alt="Bulk create mode selection" />
<figcaption>Bulk create also presents the same mode selection - choose Blank Survey or Start with AI for all groups</figcaption>
</figure>

The bulk create option presents the same two modes (Blank Survey or Start with AI), but applies your choice to all participant groups simultaneously. This is useful when you want consistent survey structure across all reviewer types.

<div class="info-box">

**Tip:** Use the "Blank Survey" option with the Question Bank for maximum control over question selection. Use "Start with AI" when you want role-specific questions generated quickly and are open to reviewing AI suggestions.

</div>

##### Building Survey Questions

Whether you start with a blank survey or AI-generated questions, you can always:

- Add questions manually using the **Add question** button
- Select additional questions from the **Question Bank**
- Choose question types: Opinion scale, Multiple choice, or Free text
- Configure scale settings (3-10 points for rating questions)
- Set questions as required or optional
- Reorder questions by dragging
- Preview the survey before saving

<div class="warning-box">

**Important:** Surveys must be created and saved before participants can submit feedback. Monitor the Surveys tab to ensure all participant groups have surveys configured before the feedback submission period begins.

</div>

### Tracking Responses (Feedback Collection)

Once surveys are created and distributed, the Responses tab becomes your central hub for monitoring feedback collection progress. This phase is critical for ensuring high participation rates and timely feedback submission.

#### Admin View: Response Tracking Dashboard

To monitor feedback collection:

1.  Navigate to the review detail page by clicking the review name
2.  Click the **Responses** tab
3.  View the employee list showing completion status for each participant

The Responses tab displays:

- **Search:** Search by employee name to find specific participants
- **Quick Filters:** All, Not started, In progress, Completed - filter by response status
- **Employee List:** Shows each participant with their avatar, name, and job title
- **Responses Received:** Shows the count of responses received vs total expected (e.g., "0/6" means 0 of 6 expected responses received)
- **Status:** Current completion status (Not started, In progress, Completed)
- **Actions:** View individual feedback details or Send reminders to pending respondents

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/360-responses-tab-tracking.png" class="screenshot" alt="Responses tab showing employee feedback collection status" />
<figcaption>Responses tab with employee list showing feedback collection progress and quick filters</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Viewing Individual Feedback

To view detailed feedback for a specific employee:

1.  In the Responses tab, locate the employee
2.  Click the **View** button in the Actions column
3.  The individual feedback page opens with tabs for each reviewer type

The individual feedback view includes:

- **Employee Tab:** Self-review responses (if self-review survey was included)
- **Line Manager Tab:** Feedback from the employee's direct manager
- **Peer Tab:** Feedback from nominated peers

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/360-feedback-individual-view.png" class="screenshot" alt="Individual feedback view with reviewer type tabs" />
<figcaption>Individual feedback view showing Employee, Line Manager, and Peer tabs</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="info-box">

**Tip:** Use the "Send reminders" action to prompt employees who haven't submitted their feedback. This helps maintain high response rates without manual follow-up.

</div>

#### Employee View: Responding to Surveys

Employees access their 360° review surveys through a dedicated personal interface:

<div class="nav-path">

**Performance** → **My 360° reviews Beta**

</div>

The employee's "My 360° reviews" page includes:

- **Overview Tab:** Shows feedback shared about the employee once available
- **Peer nominations Tab:** Where employees nominate their peers for feedback
- **Surveys Tab:** Lists all surveys the employee needs to complete (feedback about colleagues)
- **Reports Tab:** Access to finalized 360° feedback reports

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/360-my-reviews-employee-view.png" class="screenshot" alt="Employee view of My 360° reviews" />
<figcaption>Employee's "My 360° reviews" page with Overview, Peer nominations, Surveys, and Reports tabs</figcaption>
</figure>

When surveys are available, employees see them in the Surveys tab with clear calls to action to complete feedback for each colleague they've been asked to review.

<figure class="screenshot-container">
<img src="validation/screenshots/360-my-reviews-surveys-empty.png" class="screenshot" alt="Employee surveys tab showing pending surveys" />
<figcaption>Surveys tab where employees find feedback surveys to complete</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Monitoring Review Progress

The Overview page provides real-time metrics:

- **Active reviews**: Number of currently running review cycles
- **Employees involved**: Total participants across all active reviews
- **Pending peer nominations**: Number of outstanding peer nominations
- **Upcoming deadlines**: Next important dates for review activities

Use these metrics to track overall 360° feedback program health and identify reviews requiring attention.

</div>

<div id="workflow-integration" class="section section">

## Workflow Integration

<div class="info-box">

**No Workflow Integration Available:** The 360° Feedback module does not currently integrate with Bayzat Workflows. No triggers or actions are available for automating 360° review processes. All review management must be done manually through the 360° Reviews interface.

</div>

</div>

<div id="business-rules" class="section section">

## Business Rules and Limitations

### Business Rules

The 360° Feedback feature operates under the following business rules:

- **Review Lifecycle:** Reviews progress through defined stages: Draft → Ongoing → Completed. Each stage has specific actions available.
- **Participant Selection:** Only active employees can be selected as participants in a 360° review cycle.
- **Time Periods:** Three distinct time periods must be configured: Peer nomination period, Feedback submission period, and Review finalization period. These periods cannot overlap and must be sequential.
- **Peer Nominations:** Employees must nominate peers during the designated nomination period. The number of required nominations can be configured per review cycle.
- **Survey Configuration:** Feedback surveys use questions from the Question Bank and are organized by Feedback Categories (Technical Expertise, Leadership & Influence, Values & Culture Fit, Flexibility and Adaptability, Reliability and Dependability, Communication Skills, Teamwork and Collaboration).
- **Rating Scale:** Reviews use the organization's configured rating scale (3-10 points) as defined in Settings \> Performance \> Rating Scale.
- **Deletion Policy:** Deleted 360° reviews are permanently removed and cannot be recovered. All associated data including nominations, surveys, responses, and reports are deleted.
- **Beta Status:** This feature is currently in beta testing phase, indicated by the "Beta" badge in the navigation. Functionality may be subject to change based on user feedback.

### Known Limitations

<div class="info-box">

**No Critical Limitations Identified:** During validation testing, no blocking limitations were discovered for this feature. All core CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functioned as expected.

</div>

#### Feature Gaps

The following enhancement has been identified and is tracked in Jira:

| Gap Description | Impact | Status | Reference |
|----|----|----|----|
| No consolidated view for managing all participants' 360 feedback reports | Users must navigate to individual employee records to view and manage 360 feedback reports. There is no unified interface to handle reports collectively across all participants in a review cycle. | Feature request under consideration | JRV-1932 |

#### Integration Limitations

<div class="info-box">

**Workflow Integration:** The 360° Feedback feature does not currently support Bayzat Workflows. No triggers or actions are available for automation. All review processes must be managed manually through the 360° Reviews interface.

</div>

#### Best Practices

- **Plan Time Periods Carefully:** Ensure adequate time for each phase (nominations, feedback submission, finalization) based on your organization size and review complexity.
- **Communicate Deadlines:** Proactively notify participants about upcoming deadlines shown in the Overview dashboard.
- **Configure Question Bank First:** Set up your feedback questions and categories in Settings before creating review cycles to streamline the survey creation process.
- **Test with Small Groups:** Given the beta status, consider piloting with a small group before rolling out organization-wide.
- **Regular Monitoring:** Use the Overview cards to track Active reviews, Employees involved, Pending peer nominations, and Upcoming deadlines.

</div>

<div id="troubleshooting" class="section section">

## Troubleshooting & Edge Cases

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|----|----|----|
| Cannot find employee in participant selection | Only active employees appear in selection list | Verify employee status in directory; inactive employees cannot be added |
| Time period validation errors | Time periods must be sequential and non-overlapping | Ensure nomination ends before feedback begins, and feedback ends before finalization |
| "Start 360° review" button disabled | Insufficient permissions or missing prerequisites | Verify admin access to Performance module |
| Pending nominations not decreasing | Employees haven't received or understood nomination process | Check Peer nominations tab and send reminder communications |
| Cannot remove participant from ongoing review | Participant removal restricted after review starts | Edit if Draft status; otherwise wait for cycle completion |
| "Create survey" option not working | Missing configuration or wrong review status | Verify Question Bank and Feedback Categories are configured |
| Cannot view responses | Responses not submitted or permission issues | Check Responses tab for submission status and verify permissions |
| Reports tab shows no data | Review not completed or insufficient responses | Verify review has "Completed" status and response thresholds met |
| Accidentally deleted a review | Deletion is permanent and irreversible | Cannot recover; use Duplicate feature for backups before changes |

### Known Limitations

<div class="info-box">

**Consolidated Reports:** No unified interface for viewing all participants' 360 feedback reports. Navigate to individual employee profiles or use the Reports tab within each review. (Reference: JRV-1932)

</div>

<div class="info-box">

**Workflow Integration:** No 360° Feedback triggers or actions are available in Bayzat Workflows. All review processes must be managed manually.

</div>

### Edge Cases

- **Employee terminated mid-review:** Complete review cycle before processing termination, or document incomplete review
- **Overlapping review cycles:** System allows this; communicate clearly about which cycle each feedback request belongs to
- **Duplicate review names:** Use naming conventions with unique identifiers (e.g., "Q1 2024 Leadership 360")
- **Beta feature updates:** Stay informed via Bayzat release notes; document your workflows and configurations
