  "summary": "Validation attempt was blocked at the authentication stage. Multiple attempts to log in through automated browser testing failed due to React form state management preventing JavaScript automation from properly triggering form submission. The Bayzat login form uses controlled React components that require proper synthetic event handling, which standard Playwright automation techniques cannot replicate. Attempted approaches included: direct value assignment with event dispatch, React-specific setNativeValue techniques, multiple event type simulation (input, change, blur), and direct navigation to authenticated routes. All approaches resulted in either form validation errors or 404 responses. Without successful authentication, the 360\u00b0 Reviews feature located at Performance > 360\u00b0 Reviews could not be explored, and none of the validation tasks (survey creation, participant group selection, question customization) could be executed. Eight screenshots were captured documenting the various login attempts and error states. This represents a technical limitation of browser automation tools when interacting with modern React applications that use strict form state management. Manual validation by a human user or alternative authentication mechanisms are required to proceed with comprehensive feature exploration and user guide creation.",
