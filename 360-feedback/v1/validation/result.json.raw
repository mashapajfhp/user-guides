  "summary": "Validation attempt for 360 Feedback feature was blocked at the authentication stage due to technical limitations with the Playwright MCP automation tooling. While the login page loaded successfully and all UI elements were identified (email/password fields, social login buttons, magic link option), the automation framework was unable to interact with form fields or execute JavaScript in the browser context - all evaluation calls returned undefined. Multiple approaches were attempted including direct JavaScript evaluation, React-specific value setters, HTTP API login, keyboard input simulation, and direct URL navigation, all unsuccessful. The login page itself functions correctly with proper React rendering, Material-UI styling, and multiple authentication methods (email/password, Google OAuth, Microsoft OAuth, magic link). The 360 Feedback feature at Performance > 360° Reviews > Surveys remains unexplored. To complete this validation, either manual exploration by an authenticated user or resolution of the Playwright automation issues is required. The feature validation cannot proceed without successful authentication to access the internal application routes where the 360 Feedback functionality resides."
