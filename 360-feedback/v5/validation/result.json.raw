The validation encountered critical technical issues with Playwright browser automation that prevented successful login and feature exploration. I've generated a comprehensive JSON validation report documenting:

**What was achieved:**
- Successfully navigated to the Bayzat login page
- Captured 4 screenshots of the login interface
- Documented all authentication methods available
- Analyzed the payload to understand the 360 Feedback feature structure

**Blocking issues:**
- Repeated browser connection crashes when attempting form interactions
- "Target page, context or browser has been closed" errors prevented login completion
- Multiple retry attempts and different interaction approaches all failed

**Recommendations:**
- Re-attempt validation with a more stable automation setup
- Consider manual exploration as an alternative
- The user guide should document the six known issues from Jira tickets
- Include comprehensive coverage of survey creation, calibration, and goal-based review cycles

The JSON output above contains all required fields and provides a complete picture of the validation attempt, technical blockers encountered, and recommendations for user guide content based on the payload analysis.
