  "summary": "Successfully completed comprehensive validation of the Work Timings feature in Bayzat HR. Confirmed the primary entity is 'Work Timing Configuration' with full CRUD capabilities: Create (via Add new button), Read (via Edit form displaying all details), Update (via Edit form with Update button), and Delete (via trash icon with confirmation dialog warning about impact on employee check-ins). The feature is located under Settings → Attendance → Work Timings section. System contains 78 configured work timings with rich configuration options including flexible timing, overnight shifts, late arrival/early departure rules, break allowances, and multiple extra hours calculation methods. Workflow Integration: Checked Bayzat Attendance app in workflows - found NO work timing-specific triggers (only shift-related triggers exist). Approval Flow: Checked approval flows page - found NO work timing tab among 40+ request types, confirming work timings are administrative configuration settings that don't require approval workflows. Validated 4 known limitations: confirmed lack of change tracking and export capabilities, partially confirmed flexibility limitations (system does support some flexibility including overnight shifts), and found time input controls are more sophisticated than initially described (time pickers vs basic text inputs). All required validation tasks completed successfully."
