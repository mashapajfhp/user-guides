  "summary": "All 3 validation claims are logically valid and executable. VAL-001 validates daily wage formula override behavior (medium complexity). VAL-002 validates unpaid leave deduction recalculation logic with salary configuration changes (high complexity, requires multiple data states). VAL-003 validates EOS gratuity leap year day counting (high complexity, requires specific date ranges). All claims have well-defined navigation paths, observable indicators, and expected outcomes suitable for interface validation."
