Known issues (25), limitations (24), customer requests (15), edge cases (7), and troubleshooting procedures (14) are well-documented with corresponding Jira/Zendesk references. High-severity issues include unpaid leave deduction synchronization failures, calculation timing mismatches, leap year handling errors, and formula configuration precedence conflicts. Core navigation and calculation functionality claims are validated with high confidence. The feature exhibits significant complexity in gratuity calculations, proration logic, and multi-module synchronization scenarios."
