  "summary": "All 3 validation issues (VAL-001, VAL-002, VAL-003) are logically valid with high confidence. Navigation paths target standard Bayzat platform modules (Payroll Settings, Leave Management, EOS Gratuity). Observable indicators are deterministic and architecturally plausible. All 4 configuration areas validated as logically sound with expected UI elements defined. No structural inconsistencies detected. Ready for UI execution phase with 6 required screenshots across validation steps."
