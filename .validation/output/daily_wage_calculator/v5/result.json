Validation covered calculation rules (10), system behaviors (6), navigation paths (3), and known issues (5). Key findings: Core calculation logic is sound, but multiple temporal synchronization issues, configuration precedence problems, and leap year handling bugs exist. No claims were found to be invalid or contradictory."
