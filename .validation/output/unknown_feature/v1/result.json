High confidence: 89 claims (80.9%), Medium confidence: 20 claims (18.2%), Low confidence: 1 claim (0.9%). Evidence sourced from Zendesk articles (14154746403601, 14243704039185, 14243760419089), 27 unique Jira tickets (TSSD-4905, TSSD-2648, TSSD-1581, TSSD-4179, TSSD-2605, TSSD-4742, TSSD-1625, TSSD-2252, TSSD-2043, TSSD-4731, TSSD-2321, TSSD-3648, TSSD-4292, TSSD-3058, TSSD-2532, TSSD-4464, TSSD-4368, TSSD-1301, TSSD-1753, TSSD-1807), documented navigation paths, and procedural workflows. Daily Wage Calculator supports three calculation bases (calendar, working, custom days) with configurable salary components. Navigation path confirmed: Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation. System exhibits complex behavior including: formula precedence (payroll overrides policy), timing-dependent calculations (salary config vs leave request), leap year handling gaps, decimal precision limitations, and synchronization issues between Time Off and Payroll modules. Known architectural constraints: fixed 26-day standard, global configuration precedence, inability to retroactively adjust calculations, and independent configurations for leave salary vs salary proration."
