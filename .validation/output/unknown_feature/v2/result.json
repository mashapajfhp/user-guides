  "summary": "All 114 claims validated successfully. Claims span calculation rules (daily wage formulas, proration logic), system behaviors (configuration precedence, module synchronization), navigation paths (Settings > Payroll access), UI steps (calculation basis selection), known issues (leap year errors, duplicate deductions, display mismatches), limitations (fixed divisors, timing constraints, global overrides), customer requests (automation, transparency, accuracy improvements), edge cases (leap years, mid-month departures, cross-month processing), and troubleshooting guidance (verification steps, workarounds, manual interventions). All claims are internally consistent and traceable to source references (Jira tickets TSSD-* and Zendesk articles). High-severity issues include calculation automation gaps, synchronization failures, proration errors for future dates, and leap year handling defects. The feature exhibits significant complexity with multiple interacting configurations affecting salary calculations across different contexts."
