  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table.

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation.
- Access the Daily Wage Calculator via Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure
- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection
- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation to access salary proration configuration

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee; the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) must be configured.
- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to properly exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
- Super admin role and access to payroll settings; existing leave type policies and salary component structure
- Access to Leave Settings configuration as a Super Admin; ability to add a new leave policy
- Super admin role required to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary (basic plus allowance), number of working days in the month, number of public holidays in the month, and approved unpaid leave days.
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to include (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), selection of calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and configuration of eligible leave types for encashment
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table; calculated daily pay rate for unpaid leave deductions.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations; visibility of which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation method that applies daily deductions to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) payroll amounts

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve leave request, determine leave policy type (calendar or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay rate by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose salary components to factor into calculations.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure; 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances); 3. Choose monthly calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days); 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated as Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month are deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation.
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). The Daily Wage Calculation impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction.
- Salary component selection limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances; calculation method options are Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days; super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the configuration
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected when configuring the policy
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if two days are public holidays and the leave policy is based on 22 working days, daily pay is calculated on 20 days instead of 22 days.
- Calculation varies depending on month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February for calendar days). Different calculation methods can significantly impact final wage calculations, so selection of the appropriate calculation base is critical.
- Super admins must be aware that configuring leave encashment policies will overwrite existing eligible paid leave-type policies; visibility of overwritten policies is provided to prevent unintended changes
- Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days) must be selected appropriately based on organizational policy
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject existing transactions and resave proration settings to apply changes; failure to do so may result in inconsistent salary calculations

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions; integrates with leave management system to process approved unpaid leave requests and employee record systems.
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, public holiday calendar configuration, and leave management systems to calculate accurate daily wage rates for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- Interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service calculations, and Leave Management system; leave encashment configuration directly affects end-of-service calculation outcomes
- Integrates with the payroll system to apply daily unpaid leave deductions to monthly employee pay; works in conjunction with Leave Policies configuration
- Interacts with the Payroll system and payroll table; affects active payroll transactions and employee compensation calculations for first salary and end-of-service settlements
