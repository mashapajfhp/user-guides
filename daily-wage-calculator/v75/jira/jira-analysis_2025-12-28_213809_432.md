## Findings

### daily wage calculation complexity

The daily wage calculator has complex calculation logic with multiple configuration challenges and potential inconsistencies across different payroll scenarios.

_severity: high | [Tickets: TSSD-2648, TSSD-2321, TSSD-4179, TSSD-2252]_

### calculation override complexity

Global configurations can override policy-level daily wage calculation settings, creating potential misunderstandings and unexpected results.

_severity: medium | [Tickets: TSSD-1753, TSSD-2648]_

### proration calculation inconsistencies

Salary and leave proration calculations produce inconsistent results due to varying divisor methods and configuration challenges.

_severity: high | [Tickets: TSSD-4368, TSSD-2321, TSSD-4731]_

### leap year calculation limitations

Current system struggles with accurately calculating service periods and gratuity during leap years.

_severity: high | [Tickets: TSSD-4179, TSSD-1625, TSSD-2252]_

## Troubleshooting

### daily wage recalculation workaround

When calculation discrepancies occur, manual intervention or system-specific workarounds are required.

_[Tickets: TSSD-1581, TSSD-2532]_

# Claims to Validate

> **Note:** Jira claims provide test hypotheses based on ticket evidence. Navigation paths come from Zendesk documentation matching.

## Ui State

### Daily Wage Configuration Options

**Test Hypothesis:** How might we verify that users can view and configure daily wage calculation methods?

**Evidence Summary:** Multiple tickets indicate complex configuration options for daily wage calculations.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_001 | origin=jira | playwright=NO | blocker=NEEDS_ZENDESK_NAVIGATION

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-2321, TSSD-1753, TSSD-4368

**UI Indicators:**
- Daily wage divisor selection
- Salary component choices

**Selector Hints:**
- text:Daily Wage
- text:Divisor
- select:Calculation Method
- Daily wage divisor selection
- Salary component choices

**Preconditions:**
- Prepare test data to reproduce the scenario described by the ticket(s)

**Steps:**
- Log in as a user who can access the feature (admin if required)
- Navigate to the feature area relevant to this claim
- Open the relevant Settings / Configuration section for the feature

**Expected:**
- Users can select divisor method (30 days, 30.42 days, working days)
- Ability to choose salary components (basic, gross)
- Result is observable (in UI or logs) and consistent with the claim statement

### Work Week Configuration Visibility

**Test Hypothesis:** How might we verify that work week configurations impact working days calculations?

**Evidence Summary:** Work week settings determine how working days are counted for salary calculations.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_003 | origin=jira | playwright=NO | blocker=NEEDS_ZENDESK_NAVIGATION

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-4292

**UI Indicators:**
- Weekend configuration
- Public holiday settings

**Selector Hints:**
- text:Work Week
- text:Weekend
- text:Public Holidays
- Weekend configuration
- Public holiday settings

**Preconditions:**
- Prepare test data to reproduce the scenario described by the ticket(s)

**Steps:**
- Log in as a user who can access the feature (admin if required)
- Navigate to the feature area relevant to this claim
- Open the relevant Settings / Configuration section for the feature

**Expected:**
- Users can configure which days count as working days
- System respects custom work week definitions
- Result is observable (in UI or logs) and consistent with the claim statement

## System Behavior

### Leave Salary Calculation Persistence

**Test Hypothesis:** How might we verify that leave salary calculations use the initially calculated daily rate?

**Evidence Summary:** System should store and display the daily rate from the leave occurrence month.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_002 | origin=jira | playwright=NO | blocker=NEEDS_ZENDESK_NAVIGATION

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-1807

**UI Indicators:**
- Stored daily rate
- Month of leave occurrence

**Selector Hints:**
- text:Initial Rate
- text:Leave Month
- Stored daily rate
- Month of leave occurrence

**Preconditions:**
- Prepare test data to reproduce the scenario described by the ticket(s)

**Steps:**
- Log in as a user who can access the feature (admin if required)
- Navigate to the feature area relevant to this claim

**Expected:**
- Daily rate reflects month when leave was taken
- Rate not recalculated based on payroll processing month
- Result is observable (in UI or logs) and consistent with the claim statement
