  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-25  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the actual number of working or calendar days in the month. The system accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the working day count before calculating the daily rate. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the calculator automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate and consistent salary adjustments based on the organization's leave policy framework.

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Creation → Payroll Table Reflection — _The workflow begins when an unpaid leave request is approved, triggering automatic pay deduction generation and display on the payroll table_
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point for the Daily Wage Calculator feature where users configure calculation bases and salary components. | Primary navigation to access salary proration settings and calculation basis selection_

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the daily wage calculator to generate a pay deduction ; The organization must have a defined leave policy specifying either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the basis for calculation
- User must have Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor role to access and configure Daily Wage Calculator settings. ; Company must have a configured public holiday calendar to accurately exclude public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount ; Number of actual working days or calendar days in the month ; Public holidays occurring in the month — _Basic salary plus allowance components are required for the daily pay calculation formula ; Depends on the organization's leave policy framework; can be calendar days (30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) ; Public holidays must be identified and deducted from the working day count to arrive at actual working days for calculation_
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components to include — _User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (all days in a month), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined number of days, typically 30 in UAE and KSA to align with labor law). ; User must choose which salary components to factor into daily wage calculations: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only._
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days to determine how salary proration is calculated_

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction amount ; Payroll table reflection — _A calculated pay deduction is automatically created and associated with the specific unpaid leave request ; The calculated pay deduction is automatically reflected on the payroll table for the affected employee_
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System produces daily wage calculations that are applied to three main payroll areas: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction, with rates varying based on selected calculation base and salary components._
- Updated salary calculations and prorated compensation — _Changes to salary proration settings generate updated calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method; changes affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave** — _When an unpaid leave request has been approved and a salary deduction needs to be calculated and applied_
  - Receive and approve the unpaid leave request
  - Determine the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days)
  - Identify the total number of days in the policy (e.g., 30 calendar days or 22 working days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling in the month
  - Deduct public holidays from the total working days to calculate actual working days
  - Calculate daily pay using the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Actual Working Days
  - Automatically generate and apply the pay deduction to the payroll table
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up or modifying how daily wages are calculated for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions._
  - Navigate to Settings menu
  - Select Payroll option
  - Choose Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days
  - Choose salary components to include in calculation (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only)
  - Save configuration to apply to payroll calculations
- **Update Salary Proration Settings** — _When Super admin needs to change how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked, or when adjusting calculation methodology for payroll accuracy_
  - Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation
  - Select the required calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days
  - Save the changes
  - If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions before saving new proration settings
  - Confirm the new proration settings are applied

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month ; The leave policy determines whether calculations are based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count before calculating daily pay ; Pay deductions are automatically created upon approval of an unpaid leave request and are reflected on the payroll table
- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), resulting in variable daily wage rates month-to-month. ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar, resulting in fewer billable days than calendar days. ; Custom days calculation allows flexibility to set a fixed number of days per month according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with local labor law requirements. ; The selected calculation base and salary components directly impact the final daily wage rates used for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Changes to salary proration will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject those transactions before saving changes to salary proration settings

### Edge cases and warnings

- When public holidays coincide with the month for which daily pay is being calculated, they must be explicitly deducted from the working days count. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a month with a 22-day working policy, daily pay is calculated on 20 days, not 22 days
- Monthly variation in calendar days (e.g., February has 28 days while January has 31 days) will result in different daily wage calculations each month if calendar days calculation base is used, potentially affecting employee pay consistency. ; Public holiday calendar must be accurately configured for working days calculation base to function correctly; missing or incorrectly configured public holidays will result in inaccurate daily wage calculations. ; Different calculation methods (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) can produce significantly different daily wage rates for the same employee, directly impacting leave encashment and unpaid leave deduction amounts.
- If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions already submitted, Super admin must manually reject and resave those transactions after updating proration settings to ensure consistency

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table upon unpaid leave approval ; The feature depends on the leave management system to receive and process approved unpaid leave requests that trigger daily pay calculations ; The feature relies on employee records and organizational leave policy settings to determine the applicable calculation method (calendar or working days)
- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three payroll functions: salary proration (prorating salaries for partial months), leave encashment (calculating monetary value of leave balances), and unpaid leave deduction (calculating deductions for unpaid leave taken). ; Depends on company's public holiday calendar configuration to accurately exclude public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly affects active payroll table transactions, including first salary calculations and end-of-service settlements
