    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the actual number of working or calendar days in the month. The system accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the working day count before calculating the daily rate. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the calculator automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate and consistent salary adjustments based on the organization's leave policy framework."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the actual number of working or calendar days in the month. The system accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the working day count before calculating the daily rate. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the calculator automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate and consistent salary adjustments based on the organization's leave policy framework.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and automatically deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to enable accurate salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, replacing previous limited fixed calculation options.

The leave policy determines whether calculations are based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count before calculating daily pay ; Pay deductions are automatically created upon approval of an unpaid leave request and are reflected on the payroll table [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), resulting in variable daily wage rates month-to-month. ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar, resulting in fewer billable days than calendar days. ; Custom days calculation allows flexibility to set a fixed number of days per month according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with local labor law requirements. ; The selected calculation base and salary components directly impact the final daily wage rates used for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject those transactions before saving changes to salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- When public holidays coincide with the month for which daily pay is being calculated, they must be explicitly deducted from the working days count. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a month with a 22-day working policy, daily pay is calculated on 20 days, not 22 days [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Monthly variation in calendar days (e.g., February has 28 days while January has 31 days) will result in different daily wage calculations each month if calendar days calculation base is used, potentially affecting employee pay consistency. ; Public holiday calendar must be accurately configured for working days calculation base to function correctly; missing or incorrectly configured public holidays will result in inaccurate daily wage calculations. ; Different calculation methods (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) can produce significantly different daily wage rates for the same employee, directly impacting leave encashment and unpaid leave deduction amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions already submitted, Super admin must manually reject and resave those transactions after updating proration settings to ensure consistency [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table upon unpaid leave approval ; The feature depends on the leave management system to receive and process approved unpaid leave requests that trigger daily pay calculations ; The feature relies on employee records and organizational leave policy settings to determine the applicable calculation method (calendar or working days) [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three payroll functions: salary proration (prorating salaries for partial months), leave encashment (calculating monetary value of leave balances), and unpaid leave deduction (calculating deductions for unpaid leave taken). ; Depends on company's public holiday calendar configuration to accurately exclude public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
