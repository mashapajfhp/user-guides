## Findings

### calculation complexity

Daily wage calculations involve complex configurations with multiple potential divisors and calculation methods.

_severity: high | [Tickets: TSSD-2321, TSSD-4731, TSSD-3648]_

### leap year handling

Inconsistent handling of leap year days in service duration and gratuity calculations.

_severity: high | [Tickets: TSSD-4179, TSSD-1625, TSSD-2252]_

### configuration override

Global configurations can override policy-level settings in daily wage and leave calculations.

_severity: medium | [Tickets: TSSD-1753]_

## Troubleshooting

### proration workaround

Manual adjustments required when automated proration fails

_[Tickets: TSSD-2605, TSSD-4368]_

### leave deduction sync

Handling persistent deductions after leave request modifications

_[Tickets: TSSD-2532]_

## Glossary

# Claims to Validate

> **Note:** Jira claims provide test hypotheses based on ticket evidence. Navigation paths come from Zendesk documentation matching.

## Ui State

### Leap Year Day Handling

**Test Hypothesis:** How might we verify that leap year days are correctly counted in service duration calculations?

**Evidence Summary:** System sometimes fails to consistently handle 366 days in leap years for service calculations.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_001 | origin=jira | playwright=NO | blocker=NEEDS_ZENDESK_NAVIGATION

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-4179, TSSD-1625

**UI Indicators:**
- Year calculation field
- Service duration display

**Selector Hints:**
- text:Days
- text:Years
- text:Service Duration
- Year calculation field
- Service duration display

**Preconditions:**
- Prepare test data to reproduce the scenario described by the ticket(s)

**Steps:**
- Log in as a user who can access the feature (admin if required)
- Navigate to the feature area relevant to this claim

**Expected:**
- Leap years are counted with 366 days
- Partial year calculations use correct divisor
- Result is observable (in UI or logs) and consistent with the claim statement

### Multiple Daily Wage Divisor Options

**Test Hypothesis:** How might we verify that users can select between different daily wage divisors?

**Evidence Summary:** System supports configuring daily wage calculations using 30, 30.42, or working days divisors.

**Navigation Hint:** Settings > Payroll > Daily Wage Calculation

**Meta:** id=JIRA_003 | origin=jira | playwright=NO | blocker=NEEDS_ZENDESK_NAVIGATION

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-2321, TSSD-4731

**UI Indicators:**
- Divisor selection dropdown
- Configuration settings

**Selector Hints:**
- text:Divisor
- text:Working Days
- text:Calendar Days
- Divisor selection dropdown
- Configuration settings

**Steps:**
- Log in as a user who can access the feature (admin if required)
- Navigate to the feature area relevant to this claim

**Expected:**
- Multiple divisor options are available
- Users can choose between different calculation methods
- Result is observable (in UI or logs) and consistent with the claim statement

## System Behavior

### Global Configuration Precedence

**Test Hypothesis:** How might we verify that global settings override policy-level leave calculations?

**Evidence Summary:** System-wide configurations can supersede individual leave policy calculation methods.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_002 | origin=jira | playwright=NO | blocker=NEEDS_ZENDESK_NAVIGATION

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-1753

**UI Indicators:**
- Policy settings
- Global configuration toggle

**Selector Hints:**
- text:Global Settings
- text:Override
- Policy settings
- Global configuration toggle

**Preconditions:**
- Prepare test data to reproduce the scenario described by the ticket(s)

**Steps:**
- Log in as a user who can access the feature (admin if required)
- Navigate to the feature area relevant to this claim
- Open the relevant Settings / Configuration section for the feature
- Locate the UI element referenced in the claim (label/field/value/tooltip/etc.)

**Expected:**
- Global settings take precedence over policy configurations
- Policy-level calculations can be overridden
- UI state matches the claim expectation and does not show contradictory information
