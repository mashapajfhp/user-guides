  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the working days count. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.

- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee before daily pay deduction is calculated and reflected on the payroll table.
- Company's public holiday calendar must be configured to accurately exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
- Super admin role and access to payroll settings configuration
- Access to Leave Settings configuration as a Super Admin; ability to add a new leave policy
- Super admin role and access to payroll settings; if payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, those transactions must be rejected before saving new proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary (basic plus allowance), number of working days in the month, number of public holidays in the month, and the leave policy type (calendar days or working days).
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and choice of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Salary components selection (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, calculated daily pay rate, and the deduction reflected on the payroll table.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation settings that determine how daily deductions are applied to monthly employee pay
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method; changes apply to all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Access Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure; 2. Select salary components for leave encashment (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances); 3. Choose calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days); 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated as Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by the number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation.
- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days, working days, or custom days. Working days exclude weekends and public holidays from the company's public holiday calendar. Custom days allow flexibility to set calculation base according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies set custom days as 30 to comply with labor law requirements.
- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances; calculation methods available are Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days; configuration applies to eligible paid leave types
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options
- Changes to salary proration affect all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days count when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working policy, the daily pay calculation must be based on 20 days (22 minus 2), not 22 days.
- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation bases produce different daily wage rates and will impact final amounts for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new leave encashment configuration
- Multiple configuration options are available for daily rate calculation, including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances methods, as well as three day calculation types (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days), requiring careful selection based on organizational policy
- When payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and resave the proration settings for changes to take effect

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and connects with leave management systems to process approved unpaid leave requests and employee record systems.
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, the company's public holiday calendar configuration, and leave management systems to calculate accurate daily wage rates for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction features.
- Interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service calculations, and Leave Management system to customize leave encashment policies
- Interacts with the payroll system by calculating daily deductions that are applied to monthly employee pay; similar functionality exists in leave encashment configuration
- Interacts with the Payroll system and payroll table; affects active payroll transactions and employee salary calculations
