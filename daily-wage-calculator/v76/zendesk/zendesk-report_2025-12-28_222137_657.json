    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the working days count. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the working days count. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control over calculation methodology.

If payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated as Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by the number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days, working days, or custom days. Working days exclude weekends and public holidays from the company's public holiday calendar. Custom days allow flexibility to set calculation base according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies set custom days as 30 to comply with labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances; calculation methods available are Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days; configuration applies to eligible paid leave types [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days count when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working policy, the daily pay calculation must be based on 20 days (22 minus 2), not 22 days.
