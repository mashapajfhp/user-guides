    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature automatically generates pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. It supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies, ensuring accurate salary reductions based on organizational leave policies. The daily wage calculator ensures consistent and compliant payroll processing for unpaid leave scenarios."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature automatically generates pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. It supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies, ensuring accurate salary reductions based on organizational leave policies. The daily wage calculator ensures consistent and compliant payroll processing for unpaid leave scenarios.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation base counts all days in a given month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February). ; Working days calculation base excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Custom days calculation base allows payroll table managers to set a fixed number of days according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with local labor law. ; Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select and modify the calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration settings will have an effect on all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new proration changes [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- When public holidays occur during the month, they must be subtracted from the working days total. For example, if 2 days are public holidays and the leave policy is 22 working days, daily pay is calculated on 20 days, not 22 days. ; The calculation differs based on leave policy: calendar day-based policies use fixed day counts (e.g., 30 days) while working day-based policies use working days (e.g., 22 days), both subject to public holiday deductions. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation results vary by month when using calendar days due to different month lengths; February has 28 days while January has 31 days, which directly impacts daily wage rates. ; Different calculation methods (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) can produce significantly different final wage calculations for the same employee, affecting salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions before saving new salary proration settings to prevent conflicts [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator interacts with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and with the payroll system to create and reflect automatic pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The feature depends on the employee record system to access salary information (basic salary and allowances) and on the organizational calendar system to identify public holidays. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction features; configuration changes directly impact calculations in all three areas. ; When working days calculation base is selected, the feature depends on the company's public holiday calendar to accurately exclude non-working days.
