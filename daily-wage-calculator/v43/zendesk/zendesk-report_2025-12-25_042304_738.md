## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature automatically generates pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. It supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies, ensuring accurate salary reductions based on organizational leave policies. The daily wage calculator ensures consistent and compliant payroll processing for unpaid leave scenarios.

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Creation → Payroll Table Reflection — _The workflow begins when an unpaid leave request is submitted, approved, and then automatically triggers daily pay calculation and deduction creation._
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point for the Daily Wage Calculator feature. | Primary navigation to access salary proration configuration interface_

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist before daily pay deduction is calculated and created. ; Employee salary information (basic salary plus allowance) must be available in the system. ; Leave policy type (calendar days or working days) must be configured for the organization or employee.
- User role must be Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor to access and configure Daily Wage Calculator settings. ; Company public holiday calendar must be configured if selecting working days as the calculation base.
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount ; Number of actual working days in the month ; Public holidays occurring in the month ; Leave policy type — _Combination of basic salary and allowances used as the numerator in daily pay calculation. ; The denominator for daily pay calculation; can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) depending on leave policy. ; Public holiday dates must be identified and deducted from working days to calculate actual working days for the month. ; Specification of whether the organization uses calendar days or working days for leave calculations._
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components to include — _User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (total days in month), working days (business days excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined number of days). ; User must choose which salary components to factor into calculations: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only._
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days to determine how salary proration is calculated_

### Outputs and results

- Calculated daily pay rate ; Automatic pay deduction ; Payroll table reflection — _The result of dividing total salary by actual working days, used to determine the deduction amount for unpaid leave. ; A deduction record automatically created and associated with the approved unpaid leave request, calculated using the daily pay rate. ; The pay deduction is automatically reflected on the payroll table for the relevant pay period._
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System generates daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations based on selected calculation base and salary components._
- Updated salary calculations — _System applies new proration settings to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table, proportionally adjusting employee compensation based on selected calculation method_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** — _When an unpaid leave request has been approved and a pay deduction needs to be calculated and applied to an employee's salary._
  - Receive and approve the unpaid leave request
  - Determine the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) applicable to the employee
  - Identify the total number of days in the leave policy (e.g., 30 calendar days or 22 working days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling within the month
  - Subtract public holidays from the total working days to arrive at actual working days
  - Divide the employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the actual working days
  - The result is the daily pay rate used to calculate the deduction for unpaid leave days
  - The system automatically creates a pay deduction record and reflects it on the payroll table
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up or modifying how daily wages are calculated for payroll processing._
  - Navigate to Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days
  - Choose salary components to include in calculation (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only)
  - System applies selected configuration to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations
- **Update Salary Proration** — _When Super admin needs to adjust how employee salaries are prorated based on actual days worked_
  - Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation
  - Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days)
  - Save changes
  - If payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, reject existing transactions and resave the proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. ; The number of days used in calculation can be either calendar days (if following calendar days leave policy, e.g., 30 days) or working days (if following working days leave policy, e.g., 22 working days). ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at actual working days for daily pay calculation. ; Daily pay deduction is automatically created and applied only upon approval of the unpaid leave request.
- Calendar days calculation base counts all days in a given month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February). ; Working days calculation base excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Custom days calculation base allows payroll table managers to set a fixed number of days according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with local labor law. ; Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select and modify the calculation base.
- Changes to salary proration settings will have an effect on all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new proration changes

### Edge cases and warnings

- When public holidays occur during the month, they must be subtracted from the working days total. For example, if 2 days are public holidays and the leave policy is 22 working days, daily pay is calculated on 20 days, not 22 days. ; The calculation differs based on leave policy: calendar day-based policies use fixed day counts (e.g., 30 days) while working day-based policies use working days (e.g., 22 days), both subject to public holiday deductions.
- Calculation results vary by month when using calendar days due to different month lengths; February has 28 days while January has 31 days, which directly impacts daily wage rates. ; Different calculation methods (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) can produce significantly different final wage calculations for the same employee, affecting salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions before saving new salary proration settings to prevent conflicts

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and with the payroll system to create and reflect automatic pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The feature depends on the employee record system to access salary information (basic salary and allowances) and on the organizational calendar system to identify public holidays.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction features; configuration changes directly impact calculations in all three areas. ; When working days calculation base is selected, the feature depends on the company's public holiday calendar to accurately exclude non-working days.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions, including first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations
