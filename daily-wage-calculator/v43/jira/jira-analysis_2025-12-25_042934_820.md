## Known Issue

### Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation

**Statement:** System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were incorrectly based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in payroll calculation discrepancies.

### Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation

### Duplicate Payroll Deductions After Leave Recalculation

**Statement:** When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Moving the leave request back to pending/accepted does not resolve the issue. Even after deleting the unpaid leave request entirely, the unpaid leave deduction persists in payroll deductions.

### Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees

**Statement:** The system fails to correctly prorate salaries when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing. When an employee is offboarded (e.g., Nov 28th) and payroll is processed earlier (e.g., Nov 27th), the system displays the full monthly salary instead of the prorated amount.

### Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy with Leap Year Day

### Unpaid Leave Daily Rate Shows Incorrect Month

**Statement:** The system displays the daily rate from the payroll processing month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate is inconsistent with the leave period.

### Inflexible Daily Wage Calculation Method

### Gratuity Calculation Complexity

**Statement:** The system's gratuity calculation methodology differs from manual calculations, specifically in handling partial years above 5 years of service and leap year day counting. The calculation involves segmenting service periods, applying different daily rates (21 days per year for first 5 years, 30 days per year above 5 years), and using specific day count methodologies for incomplete years.

**Selector hints:**

- Fallback: locate by visible text labels and section headings

### Leave Salary Proration Calculation Discrepancy

**Statement:** The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using independent daily wage configurations with different divisors (30 vs 30.42 days), causing calculation mismatches. The client expects a consistent daily wage formula of (Basic salary + allowances / 30.42 days), but the system uses separate configurations.

### Pro-Rated End of Service Amount Calculation Error

**Statement:** End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals.

### Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Daily Wage Calculation

**Statement:** The daily wage calculator in payroll settings intentionally overrides the leave policy formula for unpaid leave. The system displays a greyed-out formula in the leave policy to indicate this override, causing user confusion about which formula is actually being applied.

### Leave Salary Accrual Report Calculation Inconsistency

**Statement:** The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. The daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals.

### End of Service Gratuity Calculation Incorrect for Leap Years
