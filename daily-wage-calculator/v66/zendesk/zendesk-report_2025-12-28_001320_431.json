    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. Public holidays are automatically deducted from working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation. The feature supports both calendar days and working days leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the calculated pay deduction is automatically created and reflected on the payroll table."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-27\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. Public holidays are automatically deducted from working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation. The feature supports both calendar days and working days leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the calculated pay deduction is automatically created and reflected on the payroll table.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, with options to select calculation bases and salary components.

Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and resave the proration settings to apply changes. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. The number of days can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if following the calendar days leave policy or working days (e.g., 22 working days) if following the working days leave policy. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). The choice of calculation base and salary components directly impacts the final daily wage amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method selection is limited to three options: Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Configuration applies specifically to leave types eligible for encashment in end-of-service scenarios. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must reject existing transactions before saving new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and deducted from the working days count.
