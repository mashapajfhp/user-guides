  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-27  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. Public holidays are automatically deducted from working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation. The feature supports both calendar days and working days leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the calculated pay deduction is automatically created and reflected on the payroll table.

- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation

### Prerequisites

- An unpaid leave request must be submitted and approved before daily pay deduction is calculated and reflected on payroll
- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to accurately exclude weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation base.
- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator.
- Access to Leave Settings as a Super Admin; ability to add a new leave policy
- Super admin role access to payroll configuration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount (Basic + Allowance), number of working days in the month, number of calendar days (if using calendar days policy), approved unpaid leave days, and public holiday dates falling in the calculation month
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and choice of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), selection of calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and configuration of eligible leave types for encashment.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, calculated daily pay rate, and deduction reflected on the payroll table
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and determines which salary components and calculation methods apply to leave encashment.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation that applies daily rates to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days to arrive at actual working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary amount by actual working days, and generate automatic payroll deduction
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service encashment calculations.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and resave the proration settings to apply changes.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. The number of days can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if following the calendar days leave policy or working days (e.g., 22 working days) if following the working days leave policy. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation.
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). The choice of calculation base and salary components directly impacts the final daily wage amounts.
- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method selection is limited to three options: Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Configuration applies specifically to leave types eligible for encashment in end-of-service scenarios.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must reject existing transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and deducted from the working days count. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22 working days policy, the daily pay calculation must be based on 20 days (22 minus 2 public holidays), not the standard 22 days.
- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation methods produce different wage rates, so selection must align with company policy and applicable labor law.
- Super admins can view which existing eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by new Daily Wage Calculator configurations, allowing them to assess the impact of changes before applying them.
- Multiple options exist for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances; day calculation can be based on calendar days, working days, or custom days depending on organizational policy
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject those transactions and then save the changes for salary proration to apply the new settings.

### Feature interactions and dependencies
