  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees who take unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar days and working days leave policies.

- Access to Leave Settings and ability to add or modify leave policies as a Super Admin.
- Super admin access to payroll settings; active payroll system with employee records

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days in the month, number of public holidays in the month, approved unpaid leave days
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), selection of calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and configuration of eligible leave types for encashment.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days) when configuring unpaid leave deduction in a leave policy.
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, calculated daily pay rate, deduction reflected on the payroll table
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- A customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and determines which salary components and calculation methods apply to leave encashment.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation settings that determine how daily deductions are applied to monthly employee pay.
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) payroll amounts

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary by actual working days, generate automatic payroll deduction
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select a calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose a calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days).
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to arrive at actual working days. The system automatically creates pay deductions upon approval of unpaid leave requests.
- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days (all days in a month), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined basis). Most UAE and KSA companies set custom days to 30 to comply with local labor law requirements.
- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method selection is limited to three options: Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Leave encashment configuration applies specifically to end-of-service calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay. Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only, Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types are available (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days).
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new proration settings

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation must be based on 20 days, not 22 days.
- Calendar days calculation varies by month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), and different calculation bases produce different daily wage rates, which impacts final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts.
- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new Daily Wage Calculator configuration, allowing visibility into the impact of changes before they are applied.
- Multiple options exist for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, requiring careful selection based on organizational payroll policies.
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for employees, Super admin must manually reject existing transactions before saving new salary proration configuration changes

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions; depends on leave management system for unpaid leave request approval; requires integration with employee record systems for salary information; connected to leave policy configuration
