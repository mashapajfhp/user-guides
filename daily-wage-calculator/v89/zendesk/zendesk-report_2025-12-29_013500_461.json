    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees who take unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar days and working days leave policies."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees who take unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar days and working days leave policies.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control and alignment to company policies and labor law requirements.

[Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days). [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to arrive at actual working days. The system automatically creates pay deductions upon approval of unpaid leave requests. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days (all days in a month), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined basis). Most UAE and KSA companies set custom days to 30 to comply with local labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method selection is limited to three options: Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Leave encashment configuration applies specifically to end-of-service calculations. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay. Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only, Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types are available (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days). [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation must be based on 20 days, not 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation varies by month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), and different calculation bases produce different daily wage rates, which impacts final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new Daily Wage Calculator configuration, allowing visibility into the impact of changes before they are applied. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Multiple options exist for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, requiring careful selection based on organizational payroll policies. [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for employees, Super admin must manually reject existing transactions before saving new salary proration configuration changes [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- Interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions; depends on leave management system for unpaid leave request approval; requires integration with employee record systems for salary information; connected to leave policy configuration [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, public holiday calendar configuration, and leave management systems to calculate accurate daily wage rates for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service calculations, and Leave Management system to customize leave encashment policies and affects how leave is valued in end-of-service settlements. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Interacts with the payroll system by calculating daily deductions that are applied to monthly employee pay; similar configuration approach to leave encashment. [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Interacts with Payroll system, payroll table (active/unpaid amounts), and employee salary calculations for first salary and end-of-service settlement [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Glossary Terms\n- Daily pay: The amount calculated by dividing an employee's total salary by the number of actual working days in a month, used to determine deductions for unpaid leave.
