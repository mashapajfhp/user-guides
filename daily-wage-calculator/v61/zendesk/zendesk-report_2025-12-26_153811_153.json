    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions aligned with the employee's specific leave policy and public holiday schedules."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-26\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions aligned with the employee's specific leave policy and public holiday schedules.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control over calculation methodology. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Primary Personas\n- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave requests and salary calculations. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Superadmin, Payroll table managers, and transaction processors who configure and manage daily wage calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admin users who manage payroll configuration and salary proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Navigation Paths\n- Access the daily wage calculator through the payroll table where automatic pay deductions are reflected following unpaid leave request approval. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings > Payroll > Daily Wage Calculation. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation to access the salary proration configuration interface. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Prerequisites\n- An unpaid leave request must be submitted and approved before the daily wage calculator generates automatic pay deductions. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Company must have a configured public holiday calendar to exclude weekends and public holidays from working days calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings in the Daily Wage Calculator. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Required Inputs\n- Employee's total salary amount (basic salary plus allowance), the applicable leave policy type (calendar days or working days), number of working or calendar days in the month, and public holidays falling within the calculation period. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only). [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days to determine how salary proration is calculated. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Expected Outputs\n- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, reflected on the payroll table, and calculated daily pay rate for the employee. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method, affecting first salary and end-of-service settlement amounts. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Procedures\n- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate payroll deduction reflected on the payroll table. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily Wage Calculation, select a calculation base from calendar days, working days, or custom days, choose salary components to include in the calculation, and apply the configuration. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select the desired calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then resave the new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of Actual Working Days. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to arrive at actual working days for the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days (all days in a month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (user-defined). Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 in January, 28 in February). Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with local labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration settings affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be explicitly deducted from the working days total when calculating daily pay. For example, if two public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation must use 20 days instead of 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Monthly day counts vary depending on the month selected; different calculation bases (calendar days, working days, custom days) can produce significantly different daily wage amounts and impact final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for employees, Super admin must manually reject existing prorated salary transactions and then save the changes to apply new salary proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and integrates with leave management and employee record systems to retrieve salary and leave policy information. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It depends on the company's configured public holiday calendar for working days calculations and interacts with payroll settings. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Interacts with the Payroll system and Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) component. Changes impact the payroll table's active transactions and affect employee compensation calculations throughout the payroll cycle. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Glossary Terms\n- Daily pay: The calculated daily wage rate used to deduct unpaid leave days from an employee's salary, computed by dividing total salary by actual working days. Actual working days: The number of working days in a month after deducting public holidays. Leave policy: Determines whether calculations use calendar days (fixed number like 30) or working days (fixed number like 22). [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days: the number of days in a given month. Working days: only business days counted, excluding weekends and public holidays set up on the company's public holiday calendar.
