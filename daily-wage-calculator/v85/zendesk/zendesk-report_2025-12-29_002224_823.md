  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table.

### Navigation paths

- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation.
- Access the Daily Wage Calculator via Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure.
- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist before daily pay deduction is calculated and reflected on the payroll table.
- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to exclude weekends and public holidays from working days calculations.
- Super admin role with access to payroll settings and end-of-service configuration.
- Access to Leave Settings configuration as a Super Admin; ability to add a new leave policy
- Super admin role required to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days or calendar days in the month based on the leave policy, and public holidays falling in the calculation month.
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment configuration.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, calculated daily pay rate, and deduction reflected on the payroll table.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and visibility of which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation method that applies daily deductions to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and save the new proration settings again.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. The number of days can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if following calendar days leave policy or working days (e.g., 22 days) if following working days leave policy. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation.
- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days (total days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days for UAE and KSA compliance with labor law). The selected calculation base directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts.
- Salary component selection limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are calendar days, working days, or custom days. Configuration applies to eligible paid leave types for end-of-service encashment.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the working days total when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 days are public holidays and the leave policy is based on 22 working days, daily pay is calculated on 20 days (22 minus 2), not the full 22 days.
- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., January has 31 days, February has 28 days), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation methods (calendar vs. working vs. custom days) produce different wage rates and must be selected carefully to align with company policy and labor law requirements.
- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new leave encashment configuration to prevent unintended policy changes.
- Multiple configuration options are available for daily rate calculation, including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, each producing different deduction amounts
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave those transactions to apply new salary proration settings

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and connects with leave management system for unpaid leave request approval and employee record systems for salary information.
- The Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It integrates with the company's public holiday calendar to determine working days and interacts with payroll settings and leave management systems.
- Interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service calculations, and Leave Management system to customize leave encashment policies affecting end-of-service benefit calculations.
- Interacts with the payroll system by calculating daily deductions that are applied to monthly employee pay; related to leave encashment configuration
- Interacts with Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions; impacts employee first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations
