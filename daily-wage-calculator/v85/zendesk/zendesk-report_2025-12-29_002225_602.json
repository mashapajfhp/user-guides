    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month.

If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and save the new proration settings again. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. The number of days can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if following calendar days leave policy or working days (e.g., 22 days) if following working days leave policy. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days (total days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days for UAE and KSA compliance with labor law). The selected calculation base directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component selection limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are calendar days, working days, or custom days. Configuration applies to eligible paid leave types for end-of-service encashment. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the working days total when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 days are public holidays and the leave policy is based on 22 working days, daily pay is calculated on 20 days (22 minus 2), not the full 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., January has 31 days, February has 28 days), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation methods (calendar vs. working vs. custom days) produce different wage rates and must be selected carefully to align with company policy and labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new leave encashment configuration to prevent unintended policy changes. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Multiple configuration options are available for daily rate calculation, including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, each producing different deduction amounts [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave those transactions to apply new salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- Interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and connects with leave management system for unpaid leave request approval and employee record systems for salary information.
