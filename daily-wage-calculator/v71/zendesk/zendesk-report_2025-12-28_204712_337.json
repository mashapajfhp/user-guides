    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculator accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days before calculating the final daily pay amount. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the specific leave policy and calendar constraints."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculator accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days before calculating the final daily pay amount. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the specific leave policy and calendar constraints.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control and alignment to company policies and labor law requirements.

Leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to calculate actual working days used in the formula. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are calendar days (number of days in the given month), working days (only business days, excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible setting according to company policies, commonly set to 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are calendar days, working days, or custom days.

For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working policy, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation bases produce different wage amounts and impact salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction outcomes. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new leave encashment configuration, allowing visibility into policy changes before implementation. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Multiple options are available for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, requiring careful selection based on organizational payroll policy [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings; failure to do so may result in outdated calculations [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- Interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions; integrates with leave management system for unpaid leave request approval and leave policy configuration; depends on employee record system for salary information [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- The Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction.
