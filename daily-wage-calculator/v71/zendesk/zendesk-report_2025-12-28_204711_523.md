  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculator accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days before calculating the final daily pay amount. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the specific leave policy and calendar constraints.

### Navigation paths

- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings > Payroll > Daily Wage Calculation.
- Access the Daily Wage Calculator via Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure.
- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee; the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) must be configured
- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to accurately exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
- Super admin role with access to payroll settings; existing leave types and payroll configuration must be in place.
- Access to Leave Settings and ability to add a new leave policy
- Super admin role access to payroll settings; existing payroll system with employee salary data

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days in the month, public holidays falling in the month, approved unpaid leave days
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), selection of calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and configuration of eligible leave types for encashment.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, calculated daily pay rate, deduction reflected on the payroll table
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and determines which paid leave types are eligible for encashment.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation settings for the leave policy that will be applied to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve leave request, determine leave policy type (calendar or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days to arrive at actual working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary amount by actual working days, generate automatic payroll deduction
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. Leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to calculate actual working days used in the formula.
- Calculation base options are calendar days (number of days in the given month), working days (only business days, excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible setting according to company policies, commonly set to 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law).
- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are calendar days, working days, or custom days. Leave encashment configuration affects end-of-service calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new salary proration changes

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the working days count when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working policy, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days.
- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation bases produce different wage amounts and impact salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction outcomes.
- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new leave encashment configuration, allowing visibility into policy changes before implementation.
- Multiple options are available for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, requiring careful selection based on organizational payroll policy
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings; failure to do so may result in outdated calculations

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions; integrates with leave management system for unpaid leave request approval and leave policy configuration; depends on employee record system for salary information
- The Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It interacts with the company's public holiday calendar and payroll settings.
- Interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service calculations, and Leave Management system to customize leave encashment policies and affect how daily wages are calculated for leave payouts.
- Interacts with the payroll system to apply daily deductions to monthly employee pay; similar to leave encashment functionality
- Interacts with Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions; impacts first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations
