## Findings

### calculation precision limitations

The daily wage calculator has multiple precision and calculation nuances that can lead to unexpected results across different scenarios.

_severity: high | [Tickets: TSSD-2252, TSSD-1625, TSSD-4179]_

### leap year calculation gap

The system inconsistently handles leap year calculations in service duration and daily wage computations.

_severity: medium | [Tickets: TSSD-4179, TSSD-1625]_

### configuration override complexity

Global configuration settings can unexpectedly override policy-level daily wage calculation methods.

_severity: high | [Tickets: TSSD-1753, TSSD-2321]_

## Troubleshooting

### unpaid leave deduction workaround

When unpaid leave deductions produce unexpected results, manual adjustments might be necessary.

_[Tickets: TSSD-4464, TSSD-1753]_

### leap year calculation verification

Manually verify service duration calculations during leap years.

_[Tickets: TSSD-4179, TSSD-1625]_

## Glossary

# Claims to Validate

> **Note:** Jira claims provide test hypotheses based on ticket evidence. Navigation paths come from Zendesk documentation matching.

## Ui State

### Leap Year Day Inclusion in Calculations

**Test Hypothesis:** How might we verify that the system correctly handles February 29th in service duration calculations?

**Evidence Summary:** System sometimes fails to consistently include leap year days in calculations.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_001 | origin=jira | playwright=NO | blocker=NEEDS_ZENDESK_NAVIGATION

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-4179, TSSD-1625

**UI Indicators:**
- Calculation result
- Service duration display

**Selector Hints:**
- text:Days
- text:Years
- text:Service Duration
- Calculation result
- Service duration display

**Preconditions:**
- Prepare test data to reproduce the scenario described by the ticket(s)

**Steps:**
- Log in as a user who can access the feature (admin if required)
- Navigate to the feature area relevant to this claim

**Expected:**
- Leap year includes 366 days
- February 29th is counted in service duration
- Result is observable (in UI or logs) and consistent with the claim statement

## System Boundary

### Global Settings Override Policy Configurations

**Test Hypothesis:** How might we verify that global daily rate settings take precedence over policy-level configurations?

**Evidence Summary:** System has a global configuration that can override individual policy settings for daily wage calculations.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_002 | origin=jira | playwright=NO | blocker=NEEDS_ZENDESK_NAVIGATION

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-1753

**UI Indicators:**
- Global configuration toggle
- Policy settings section

**Selector Hints:**
- text:Global Settings
- text:Override
- checkbox
- Global configuration toggle
- Policy settings section

**Preconditions:**
- Prepare test data to reproduce the scenario described by the ticket(s)

**Steps:**
- Log in as a user who can access the feature (admin if required)
- Navigate to the feature area relevant to this claim
- Open the relevant Settings / Configuration section for the feature
- Locate the UI element referenced in the claim (label/field/value/tooltip/etc.)

**Expected:**
- Global daily rate configuration exists
- Global settings can override policy-level calculations
- UI state matches the claim expectation and does not show contradictory information
