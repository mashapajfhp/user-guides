  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the working days total. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, an automatic pay deduction is created and reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar days and working days leave policies.

- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar or working days), calculate total working days, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay rate by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction.
- 1. Navigate to Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation. 2. Select the calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days). 3. Choose salary components to include in the calculation. 4. System applies the daily wage calculation to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- 1. Access Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure; 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances); 3. Choose calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days); 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days).
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days. The leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation.
- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 for January, 28 for February). Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays set up in the company's public holiday calendar. Custom days allows flexibility to set a fixed number of days per month (e.g., 30 days for UAE and KSA companies to comply with labor law). Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select the calculation base.
- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances; calculation methods are limited to calendar days, working days, or custom days; configuration applies to eligible paid leave types only
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay. Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only, Basic + Allowances) and multiple day type options (calendar days, working days, custom days).
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if two days are public holidays in a 22-day working month, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22 days.
- Calculation results vary depending on the selected calculation base and month length. Different calculation methods can significantly impact final wage calculations for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. Companies must ensure the selected calculation base aligns with applicable labor law requirements.
- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new Daily Wage Calculator configuration
- Multiple options exist for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, requiring careful selection based on organizational policy requirements.
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and connects with leave management and employee record systems.
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with payroll settings, the company's public holiday calendar configuration, and leave management systems to calculate accurate daily wage rates for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- Interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service calculations, and Leave Management system to customize leave encashment policies
- Interacts with the payroll system by calculating daily deductions that are applied to monthly employee pay; similar to leave encashment functionality.
- Interacts with Payroll system, payroll table (active/unpaid amounts), and affects employee first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations
