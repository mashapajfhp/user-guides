  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-27  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to determine the accurate deduction amount. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates and reflects the corresponding pay deduction on the payroll table.

- Allow super admins to configure and customize leave encashment policies for end-of-service calculations by selecting salary components and calculation methods.
- To calculate and manage unpaid leave deductions on a daily basis for employee payroll, enabling Super Admins to configure deduction calculations when adding new leave policies
- To adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement.

### Navigation paths

- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation.
- Access the Daily Wage Calculator by navigating to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure.
- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Selecting Unpaid leave option
- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation to access salary proration configuration.

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee before daily pay deduction is calculated and reflected on the payroll table.
- Company's public holiday calendar must be configured to accurately exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
- Super admin role and access to payroll settings are required to use the Daily Wage Calculator.
- Access to Leave Settings configuration as a Super Admin; ability to add or modify leave policies
- Super admin role required to access and modify salary proration settings.

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days in the month, number of calendar days in the month (if using calendar day policy), and the dates of public holidays falling in the month.
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment configuration.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days) when configuring unpaid leave deductions
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days.

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, calculated daily pay rate, and the deduction reflected on the payroll table.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and visibility of which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation settings that determine how daily deductions are applied to employee monthly pay
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method, affecting first salary and end-of-service settlement amounts.

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary amount by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Access Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations. 5. Review which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to arrive at actual working days.
- Three calculation bases are available: calendar days (number of days in the given month), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), and custom days (flexible configuration per company policy). Most UAE and KSA companies set custom days as 30 to comply with labor law requirements.
- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are restricted to Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Configuration applies to eligible paid leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances; day calculation types are limited to Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days total when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22 days.
- Calendar days calculation varies by month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), and different calculation bases can significantly impact final wage calculations. Selection of calculation base and salary components directly affects salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts.
- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new leave encashment configuration, allowing them to review potential impacts before finalizing settings.
- Multiple options exist for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, requiring careful selection based on organizational payroll policies
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject existing prorated salary transactions before saving new proration settings to ensure changes take effect.

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Interacts with the payroll system by calculating daily deductions that are applied to monthly employee pay; integrates with Leave Policies configuration and Leave Settings
- Interacts with the Payroll system and Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) module; affects active payroll table transactions and employee salary calculations.
