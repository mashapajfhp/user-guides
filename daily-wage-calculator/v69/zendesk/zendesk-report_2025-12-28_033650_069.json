    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to determine the accurate deduction amount. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates and reflects the corresponding pay deduction on the payroll table."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-27\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to determine the accurate deduction amount. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates and reflects the corresponding pay deduction on the payroll table.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control over calculation methodology.

If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to arrive at actual working days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Three calculation bases are available: calendar days (number of days in the given month), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), and custom days (flexible configuration per company policy). Most UAE and KSA companies set custom days as 30 to comply with labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are restricted to Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Configuration applies to eligible paid leave types for end-of-service calculations.
