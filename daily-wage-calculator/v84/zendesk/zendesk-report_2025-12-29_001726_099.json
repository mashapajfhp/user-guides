    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the total working days, and supports both calendar day and working day leave policies. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary adjustments based on the employee's leave policy and the specific month's working days."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the total working days, and supports both calendar day and working day leave policies. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary adjustments based on the employee's leave policy and the specific month's working days.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, with multiple calculation bases to align with company policies and labor law requirements.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base.

If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used as the base. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in a given month (e.g., 31 for January, 28 for February). Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays from the company's public holiday calendar. Custom days allows flexibility for company-specific policies, with most UAE and KSA companies using 30 custom days to comply with labor law. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances; calculation method options are Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days; configuration applies to eligible paid leave-type policies which may overwrite existing policies [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working day policy, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation results vary depending on month length and the selected calculation base; different calculation methods can significantly impact final wage calculations for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new leave encashment configuration to prevent unintended policy changes [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Multiple options are available for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, requiring careful selection based on organizational payroll policy [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and integrates with leave management systems to process approved unpaid leave requests and employee record systems to access salary information.
