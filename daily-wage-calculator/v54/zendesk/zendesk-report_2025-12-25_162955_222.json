    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays and the applicable leave policy (calendar or working days). When an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary reductions based on the employee's leave policy and calendar constraints."

The article includes an example showing that if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working day policy, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days instead of 22."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays and the applicable leave policy (calendar or working days). When an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary reductions based on the employee's leave policy and calendar constraints.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and automatically deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of actual working days or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages that impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, allowing companies to align calculations with their policies and local labor law requirements.

[Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admin [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Navigation Paths\n- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Generation → Payroll Table Reflection | context: The workflow begins when an unpaid leave request is submitted, proceeds through approval, and concludes with automatic deduction creation visible on payroll. | [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation | context: Primary access point to configure the Daily Wage Calculator and select calculation bases and salary components. | Primary navigation path to access salary proration configuration settings | [Articles: 14243704039185, 14243760419089]\n\n## Prerequisites\n- An unpaid leave request must be approved before the daily wage calculator generates pay deductions. ; The organization must have a defined leave policy specifying whether calculations use calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). ; Employee salary information including basic salary and allowances must be available in the system. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- User must have Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor role to access and configure Daily Wage Calculator settings. ; Company must have a configured public holiday calendar to accurately exclude public holidays from working days calculations.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February). ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Custom days calculation allows flexible definition of the calculation base according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies set custom days to 30 to align with local labor law. ; Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select and modify the calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new salary proration changes [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from working days; for example, if December 2nd and 3rd are National Day holidays and the policy uses 22 working days, daily pay is calculated on 20 days (22 minus 2 public holidays), not the baseline 22 days. ; Different leave policies (calendar days vs. working days) will produce different daily pay calculations for the same salary, so the correct policy must be applied. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Monthly variation in calendar days affects daily wage calculations; months with different day counts (28, 29, 30, or 31 days) will produce different daily wage rates when using calendar days calculation base. ; Public holiday calendar accuracy is critical for working days calculations; missing or incorrectly configured public holidays will result in inaccurate daily wage calculations. ; Selection of different salary components (basic salary only vs. basic salary plus allowances) significantly impacts final daily wage rates and downstream calculations for leave encashment and unpaid leave deductions. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have already been submitted for employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions before saving new salary proration settings to avoid conflicts [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator interacts with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and with the payroll system to automatically generate and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The feature depends on employee record systems to access salary information (basic + allowance) and on calendar/holiday management systems to identify public holidays. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations; changes to the calculation base or salary components affect all three payroll areas. ; Depends on company public holiday calendar configuration for accurate working days calculation. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly affects active payroll table transactions, impacting both first salary calculations and end-of-service settlements [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Glossary Terms\n- Daily Pay ; Actual Working Days ; Unpaid Leave: The calculated daily salary amount derived by dividing the total salary (Basic + Allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month; used to determine the deduction amount for each unpaid leave day. ; The number of working days in a month after deducting public holidays from the baseline working days count (e.g., 22 working days minus 2 public holidays equals 20 actual working days). ; An approved leave period for which the employee does not receive salary; the daily wage calculator computes the salary deduction for each unpaid leave day.
