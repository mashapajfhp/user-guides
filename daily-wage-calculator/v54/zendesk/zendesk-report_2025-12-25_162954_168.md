  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-25  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays and the applicable leave policy (calendar or working days). When an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary reductions based on the employee's leave policy and calendar constraints.

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Generation → Payroll Table Reflection — _The workflow begins when an unpaid leave request is submitted, proceeds through approval, and concludes with automatic deduction creation visible on payroll._
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point to configure the Daily Wage Calculator and select calculation bases and salary components. | Primary navigation path to access salary proration configuration settings_

### Prerequisites

- An unpaid leave request must be approved before the daily wage calculator generates pay deductions. ; The organization must have a defined leave policy specifying whether calculations use calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). ; Employee salary information including basic salary and allowances must be available in the system.
- User must have Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor role to access and configure Daily Wage Calculator settings. ; Company must have a configured public holiday calendar to accurately exclude public holidays from working days calculations.
- User must have Super admin role to modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary (Basic + Allowance) ; Number of actual working days in the month ; Leave policy type (calendar days or working days) ; Public holidays in the month — _The combined basic salary and allowances used as the numerator in the daily pay calculation formula. ; Total working days in the month minus public holidays; used as the denominator in the daily pay calculation. ; Determines whether the calculation uses calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the baseline. ; Specific dates designated as public holidays that must be subtracted from the working days count._
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components to include — _User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (total days in a month), working days (business days excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (user-defined number of days per month). ; User must choose which salary components to factor into daily wage calculations: basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only._
- Calculation basis selection — _Choose one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days_

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request ; Calculated daily pay rate — _Upon approval of unpaid leave, the system automatically creates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. ; The derived daily pay amount expressed as Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month._
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System generates daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations based on the selected calculation base and salary components._
- Updated salary calculations — _Proportionally adjusted employee compensation based on selected calculation method; affects all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** — _When an unpaid leave request has been approved and a salary deduction must be calculated and applied to the employee's payroll._
  - Receive and approve an unpaid leave request from an employee.
  - Identify the leave policy in effect (calendar days or working days).
  - Determine the baseline number of days (e.g., 30 calendar days or 22 working days).
  - Identify all public holidays falling within the month for which daily pay is being calculated.
  - Subtract public holidays from the baseline working days to arrive at actual working days.
  - Obtain the employee's total salary amount (Basic + Allowance).
  - Apply the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days.
  - The system automatically creates and reflects the pay deduction on the payroll table.
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up or modifying how daily wages are calculated for payroll processing._
  - Navigate to Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select a calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days
  - Choose salary components to include in the calculation (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only)
  - Confirm and save the configuration
- **Update Salary Proration** — _When configuring how employee salaries should be prorated based on days worked_
  - Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation
  - Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days)
  - Save changes
  - If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions first, then save the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing the employee's total salary (Basic + Allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. ; The leave policy determines the baseline: either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). ; Public holidays falling within the month must be deducted from the working days count to calculate actual working days. ; Pay deductions are automatically created and reflected on the payroll table only upon approval of the unpaid leave request.
- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February). ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Custom days calculation allows flexible definition of the calculation base according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies set custom days to 30 to align with local labor law. ; Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select and modify the calculation base.
- Changes to salary proration will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new salary proration changes

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from working days; for example, if December 2nd and 3rd are National Day holidays and the policy uses 22 working days, daily pay is calculated on 20 days (22 minus 2 public holidays), not the baseline 22 days. ; Different leave policies (calendar days vs. working days) will produce different daily pay calculations for the same salary, so the correct policy must be applied.
- Monthly variation in calendar days affects daily wage calculations; months with different day counts (28, 29, 30, or 31 days) will produce different daily wage rates when using calendar days calculation base. ; Public holiday calendar accuracy is critical for working days calculations; missing or incorrectly configured public holidays will result in inaccurate daily wage calculations. ; Selection of different salary components (basic salary only vs. basic salary plus allowances) significantly impacts final daily wage rates and downstream calculations for leave encashment and unpaid leave deductions.
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have already been submitted for employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions before saving new salary proration settings to avoid conflicts

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and with the payroll system to automatically generate and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The feature depends on employee record systems to access salary information (basic + allowance) and on calendar/holiday management systems to identify public holidays.
- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations; changes to the calculation base or salary components affect all three payroll areas. ; Depends on company public holiday calendar configuration for accurate working days calculation.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly affects active payroll table transactions, impacting both first salary calculations and end-of-service settlements
