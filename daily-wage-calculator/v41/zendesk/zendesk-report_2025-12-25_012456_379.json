    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes the daily pay rate for employees taking unpaid leave by dividing their total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. It accounts for different leave policies (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from the working day count to ensure accurate salary deductions. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This feature ensures consistent and compliant salary calculations across the organization's leave management process."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-24\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes the daily pay rate for employees taking unpaid leave by dividing their total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. It accounts for different leave policies (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from the working day count to ensure accurate salary deductions. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This feature ensures consistent and compliant salary calculations across the organization's leave management process.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days, accounting for public holidays and leave policy type. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control over calculation bases and salary components. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement by selecting appropriate calculation bases (custom days, calendar days, or working days).

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February). ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Custom days calculation allows payroll managers to set a fixed number of days per month according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies set this to 30 days to comply with local labor law. ; Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select and modify the calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration settings will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving. ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new proration changes. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- When public holidays occur during the calculation month, they must be explicitly subtracted from the working days total. For example, if 2 days are public holidays and the policy is 22 working days, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22 days. ; Organizations using calendar days leave policy (e.g., 30 days) will calculate daily pay differently than those using working days policy (e.g., 22 days); ensure the correct policy type is applied. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Monthly variation in calendar days (ranging from 28 to 31 days) will directly impact calculated daily wage rates when using calendar days as the calculation base. ; Different calculation methods (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) will produce different daily wage rates and therefore different final amounts for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings; failure to do so may result in inconsistent salary calculations. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- Interacts with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests that trigger the daily pay calculation. ; Integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table based on calculated daily pay. ; Depends on employee records system to retrieve salary information (Basic + Allowance) for each employee. ; Relies on calendar/holiday management system to identify public holidays that must be deducted from working days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations within the payroll system. ; When working days calculation base is selected, the feature depends on the company's public holiday calendar to exclude public holidays from the calculation. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly affects active payroll table transactions, particularly impacting first salary calculations and end-of-service settlements. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Glossary Terms\n- Daily Pay ; Actual Working Days ; Unpaid Leave ; Leave Policy: The calculated daily wage rate derived from dividing an employee's total salary (Basic + Allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, used for unpaid leave deductions. ; The number of working days in a month after deducting public holidays from the total working days count (e.g., 22 working days minus 2 public holidays equals 20 actual working days). ; Employee leave time that results in a salary deduction based on the calculated daily pay rate; requires approval before the automatic pay deduction is created. ; The framework determining whether leave is calculated based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days), which affects the daily pay calculation denominator.
