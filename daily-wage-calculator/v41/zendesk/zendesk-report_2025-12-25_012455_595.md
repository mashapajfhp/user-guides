  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-24  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes the daily pay rate for employees taking unpaid leave by dividing their total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. It accounts for different leave policies (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from the working day count to ensure accurate salary deductions. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This feature ensures consistent and compliant salary calculations across the organization's leave management process.

## Knowledge Extract

### Job to be done

- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days, accounting for public holidays and leave policy type.
- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control over calculation bases and salary components.
- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement by selecting appropriate calculation bases (custom days, calendar days, or working days).

### Primary personas

- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave requests, approving unpaid leave, and ensuring accurate salary calculations and payroll deductions.
- Superadmin, Payroll table managers, and transaction processors who configure and manage daily wage calculations for payroll processing.
- Super admin

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Generation → Payroll Table Reflection — _The standard workflow for processing unpaid leave and triggering daily wage calculations through the payroll system._
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point to open and configure the Daily Wage Calculator tool. | Primary navigation path to access salary proration configuration interface_

### Prerequisites

- Unpaid leave request must be approved before daily pay deduction is created and reflected on the payroll table. ; Leave policy type must be established (either calendar days or working days policy) for the organization or employee.
- User must have Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator. ; Company must have a public holiday calendar configured if selecting working days as the calculation base.
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount ; Number of actual working days in the month ; Public holidays falling within the calculation month — _Comprises Basic salary plus Allowance components used as the numerator in daily pay calculation. ; The denominator for daily pay calculation; can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) depending on leave policy, with public holidays subtracted from working days. ; Must be identified and deducted from working days to calculate actual working days for daily pay computation._
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components selection — _User must select from three options: calendar days (total days in a given month), working days (business days excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (user-defined number of days per month). ; User must choose which salary components to include in the daily wage calculation: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only._
- Calculation basis selection — _Choose from three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days_

### Outputs and results

- Calculated daily pay rate ; Automatic pay deduction — _Derived from the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. ; Associated with the approved unpaid leave request and automatically created upon leave approval, reflected on the payroll table._
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System generates daily wage rates that are applied to three payroll areas: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations._
- Updated salary calculations — _Proportionally adjusted employee compensation based on selected calculation method, affecting all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** — _When an unpaid leave request is approved and a salary deduction needs to be generated for the payroll system._
  - Receive and approve the unpaid leave request
  - Determine the applicable leave policy type (calendar days or working days)
  - Identify the total number of days in the policy (e.g., 30 calendar days or 22 working days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling within the month of calculation
  - Subtract public holidays from the total working days to obtain actual working days
  - Retrieve the employee's total salary amount (Basic + Allowance)
  - Apply the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount / Actual Working Days
  - System automatically creates the pay deduction and reflects it on the payroll table
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up or updating daily wage calculation methodology for payroll processing._
  - Navigate to Settings from the main menu
  - Select Payroll from the settings options
  - Click on Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select the desired calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days
  - Choose which salary components to include in the calculation
  - Apply the configuration to activate the daily wage calculation method
- **Update Salary Proration** — _When configuring or modifying how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked_
  - Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation
  - Select calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days
  - Make necessary changes with required calculation bases
  - Save changes
  - If payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, reject existing transactions before saving new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (Basic + Allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, not calendar days unless the leave policy explicitly uses calendar days. ; Leave policy can follow either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 working days) framework; the policy type determines which base number is used in the calculation. ; Public holidays falling within the calculation month must be deducted from the working days count to arrive at actual working days for the daily pay calculation. ; Pay deduction is automatically created and reflected on the payroll table only upon approval of the unpaid leave request; no manual intervention is required.
- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February). ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Custom days calculation allows payroll managers to set a fixed number of days per month according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies set this to 30 days to comply with local labor law. ; Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select and modify the calculation base.
- Changes to salary proration settings will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving. ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new proration changes.

### Edge cases and warnings

- When public holidays occur during the calculation month, they must be explicitly subtracted from the working days total. For example, if 2 days are public holidays and the policy is 22 working days, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22 days. ; Organizations using calendar days leave policy (e.g., 30 days) will calculate daily pay differently than those using working days policy (e.g., 22 days); ensure the correct policy type is applied.
- Monthly variation in calendar days (ranging from 28 to 31 days) will directly impact calculated daily wage rates when using calendar days as the calculation base. ; Different calculation methods (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) will produce different daily wage rates and therefore different final amounts for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- When payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings; failure to do so may result in inconsistent salary calculations.

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Interacts with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests that trigger the daily pay calculation. ; Integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table based on calculated daily pay. ; Depends on employee records system to retrieve salary information (Basic + Allowance) for each employee. ; Relies on calendar/holiday management system to identify public holidays that must be deducted from working days.
- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations within the payroll system. ; When working days calculation base is selected, the feature depends on the company's public holiday calendar to exclude public holidays from the calculation.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly affects active payroll table transactions, particularly impacting first salary calculations and end-of-service settlements.
