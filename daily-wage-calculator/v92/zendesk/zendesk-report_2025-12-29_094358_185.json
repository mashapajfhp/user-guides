    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a system component that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculator accounts for leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working day counts. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-29\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a system component that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculator accounts for leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working day counts. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, with options to select calculation bases and salary components. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- To allow super admins to configure and customize leave encashment policies for end-of-service calculations, enabling control over which salary components are included and how daily wages are calculated for leave encashment purposes. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Calculate and manage unpaid leave deductions on a daily basis to be set off against the employee's monthly pay [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- To adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Primary Personas\n- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave and salary calculations.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to accurately exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator settings. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Access to Leave Settings and ability to add or modify leave policies [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Super admin role and access to payroll settings; existing payroll system with employee salary data [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Required Inputs\n- Employee's total salary amount (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days or calendar days in the month based on leave policy, public holidays falling in the month, approved unpaid leave days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to include (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select a calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose salary components to factor into calculations.

[Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days) [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and resave the proration settings to apply changes. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to determine actual working days used in the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). The selected calculation base directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method selection is limited to three options: calendar days, working days, or custom days. Leave encashment configuration applies specifically to end-of-service calculations. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated daily and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected when configuring the policy [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully considered and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working policy, the daily pay calculation must use 20 days instead of 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations.
