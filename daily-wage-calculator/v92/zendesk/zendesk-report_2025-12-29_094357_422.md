  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a system component that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculator accounts for leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working day counts. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table.

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation.
- Access the Daily Wage Calculator by navigating to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure.
- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee; the employee's salary information (basic and allowance components) must be configured in the system; the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) must be defined.
- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to accurately exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator settings.
- Access to Leave Settings and ability to add or modify leave policies
- Super admin role and access to payroll settings; existing payroll system with employee salary data

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days or calendar days in the month based on leave policy, public holidays falling in the month, approved unpaid leave days.
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to include (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), selection of calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and configuration of eligible leave types for encashment.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction is created and reflected on the payroll table; calculated daily pay rate for unpaid leave deduction is generated.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations, with visibility into which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation method that applies daily deductions to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request; approve leave request; determine leave policy type (calendar days or working days); calculate total working days in the month; subtract public holidays from working days to arrive at actual working days; calculate daily pay by dividing salary amount (basic plus allowance) by actual working days; generate automatic payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select a calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose salary components to factor into calculations.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations. 5. Review which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and resave the proration settings to apply changes.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to determine actual working days used in the calculation.
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). The selected calculation base directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts.
- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method selection is limited to three options: calendar days, working days, or custom days. Leave encashment configuration applies specifically to end-of-service calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated daily and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected when configuring the policy
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully considered and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working policy, the daily pay calculation must use 20 days instead of 22 days.
- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation methods can produce significantly different wage amounts, so selection must align with company policy and applicable labor law.
- Super admins should be aware that configuring leave encashment policies will overwrite existing eligible paid leave-type policies. The system provides visibility into which policies will be affected by the configuration changes.
- Multiple options are available for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, providing flexibility in how deductions are computed
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings; failure to do so may result in transactions using outdated proration calculations

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions; it depends on the leave management system for approved unpaid leave requests and leave policy configuration; it requires integration with employee record systems to access salary information.
