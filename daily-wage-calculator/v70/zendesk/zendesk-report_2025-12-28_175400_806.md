  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation.
- Access the Daily Wage Calculator via Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure
- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection
- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation to access salary proration configuration

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist before daily pay deduction is calculated and reflected on the payroll table
- Company's public holiday calendar must be configured to properly exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
- User must have super admin role to access and configure leave encashment policies
- Access to Leave Settings and Leave Policies configuration area with Super Admin privileges
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days in the month, and approved unpaid leave days; the system also requires knowledge of the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days) and public holidays falling in the month
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and choice of salary components to include (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Salary components selection (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method selection (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment configuration
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, calculated daily pay rate, and deduction reflected on the payroll table
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and visibility of which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation settings that determine daily rate calculations for monthly payroll processing
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method, affecting first salary and end-of-service settlement amounts

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary amount by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to factor into calculations.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations. 5. Review which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and save the new proration settings again.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of actual working days in the month; the number of days can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if following a calendar days leave policy or working days (e.g., 22 days) if following a working days leave policy; public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation
- Calculation base options are calendar days (all days in a month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible basis set by payroll managers). Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with labor law requirements.
- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are limited to Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Leave encashment configuration affects end-of-service calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated daily and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected when configuring the policy
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay; for example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22 working day policy, the daily pay calculation must use 20 days instead of 22 days
- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation methods produce different wage amounts, so selection of the appropriate base is critical.
- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new leave encashment configuration, allowing them to review potential impacts before finalizing settings
- Multiple calculation method options (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and day calculation types (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days) are available, requiring careful selection based on organizational leave policy requirements
- When payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and integrates with leave management systems to process approved unpaid leave requests and employee record systems to access salary information
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, public holiday calendar configuration, and leave management systems to determine accurate daily wage rates for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service calculations, and Leave Management system to customize leave encashment policies
- Interacts with the payroll system by calculating daily deductions that are applied to monthly employee pay; similar to leave encashment functionality
- Interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions; changes impact first salary calculations and end-of-service settlement amounts
