    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions with multiple calculation base options.

[Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Access the Daily Wage Calculator via Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation to access salary proration configuration [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Prerequisites\n- An approved unpaid leave request must exist before daily pay deduction is calculated and reflected on the payroll table [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Company's public holiday calendar must be configured to properly exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base.

[Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of actual working days in the month; the number of days can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if following a calendar days leave policy or working days (e.g., 22 days) if following a working days leave policy; public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are calendar days (all days in a month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible basis set by payroll managers).

[Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay; for example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22 working day policy, the daily pay calculation must use 20 days instead of 22 days [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation methods produce different wage amounts, so selection of the appropriate base is critical.
