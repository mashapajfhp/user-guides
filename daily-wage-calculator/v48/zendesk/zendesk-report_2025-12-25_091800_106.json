    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the daily pay rate by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature automatically generates corresponding pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. It supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies, ensuring accurate salary reductions across different organizational leave structures."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the daily pay rate by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature automatically generates corresponding pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. It supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies, ensuring accurate salary reductions across different organizational leave structures.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and automatically deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation uses actual month length: 31 days for January, 28 days for February, etc. ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar ; Custom days calculation allows payroll managers to set a fixed number of days per month according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies set custom days to 30 to align with labor law ; Only Superadmins, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select and modify the calculation base [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration settings will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon save.

[Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully tracked and subtracted from working days. For example, if 2 days are public holidays (e.g., National Day on 2nd and 3rd of December) in a month with 22 working days, the calculation must use 20 days (22 - 2), not the full 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Monthly day count variations affect daily wage calculations: February has fewer days than other months, which impacts calculated daily rates when using calendar days method ; Different calculation bases (calendar days, working days, custom days) produce different daily wage amounts and can significantly impact final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have already been submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings to apply updated calculations.
