  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-25  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the daily pay rate by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature automatically generates corresponding pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. It supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies, ensuring accurate salary reductions across different organizational leave structures.

## Knowledge Extract

### Job to be done

- Calculate and automatically deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays.
- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts, addressing previous limitations in calculation options.
- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement by selecting appropriate calculation bases (custom days, calendar days, or working days).

### Primary personas

- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave requests, approving unpaid leave, and ensuring accurate salary calculations and payroll deductions.

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Generation → Payroll Table Reflection — _The workflow begins when an unpaid leave request is approved, triggering automatic calculation and deduction creation._
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point for Daily Wage Calculator feature | Primary navigation to access salary proration configuration and calculation basis selection_

### Prerequisites

- Approved unpaid leave request must be submitted and processed through the leave management system. ; Employee salary information (basic salary and allowances) must be available in the system. ; Leave policy configuration must be established (either calendar days or working days based).
- Company public holiday calendar must be configured to exclude weekends and public holidays from working days calculations
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) ; Number of actual working days in the month ; Public holidays in the month — _The total monthly salary comprising base salary and any applicable allowances, used as the numerator in the daily pay calculation. ; The total working days available in the month, adjusted for public holidays. Can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) depending on leave policy. ; Dates of public holidays that fall within the month, which must be deducted from the working days count to arrive at actual working days._
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components selection — _User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (total days in month), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined number of days) ; User must choose which salary components to include in calculations: basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only_
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days to determine how salary proration is calculated_

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction reflected on payroll table ; Calculated daily pay rate — _Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, a pay deduction is automatically created and displayed on the payroll table for the affected employee. ; The derived daily pay amount computed as Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by the number of actual working days, used to determine the total deduction for unpaid leave days._
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System generates daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations based on selected parameters_
- Updated salary calculations — _System recalculates all active unpaid payroll amounts based on the selected calculation basis, proportionally adjusting employee compensation according to the new proration method_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** — _When an unpaid leave request is approved and a salary deduction needs to be calculated and applied to the employee's payroll._
  - Receive and approve the unpaid leave request
  - Determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days)
  - Identify the total number of days in the leave policy (e.g., 30 calendar days or 22 working days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling in the month
  - Subtract public holidays from the total days to calculate actual working days
  - Divide the employee's total salary (Basic + Allowance) by the actual working days to calculate daily pay
  - Multiply the daily pay by the number of unpaid leave days approved
  - Automatically generate and reflect the pay deduction on the payroll table
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up payroll system or updating daily wage calculation methodology_
  - Navigate to Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days
  - Choose salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only)
  - System applies selected configuration to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations
- **Update Salary Proration** — _When Super admin needs to change how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked (first salary, end-of-service settlement, or ongoing payroll adjustments)_
  - Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation
  - Select the required calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days
  - Save changes
  - If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject the transactions before saving new proration settings
  - Confirm new proration settings are applied to all active unpaid payroll amounts

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month ; The number of days used in calculation can be either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if following calendar days leave policy, or working days (e.g., 22 days) if following working days leave policy. ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to arrive at the actual working days used in the daily pay calculation.
- Calendar days calculation uses actual month length: 31 days for January, 28 days for February, etc. ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar ; Custom days calculation allows payroll managers to set a fixed number of days per month according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies set custom days to 30 to align with labor law ; Only Superadmins, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select and modify the calculation base
- Changes to salary proration settings will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon save. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the existing transactions before saving new proration settings to avoid conflicts.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully tracked and subtracted from working days. For example, if 2 days are public holidays (e.g., National Day on 2nd and 3rd of December) in a month with 22 working days, the calculation must use 20 days (22 - 2), not the full 22 days.
- Monthly day count variations affect daily wage calculations: February has fewer days than other months, which impacts calculated daily rates when using calendar days method ; Different calculation bases (calendar days, working days, custom days) produce different daily wage amounts and can significantly impact final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have already been submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings to apply updated calculations.

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Integrates with leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and with payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; Depends on employee record system for salary information (basic salary and allowances) and public holiday calendar for accurate working day calculations.
- Daily Wage Calculator impacts and is used by three dependent payroll functions: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations ; Working days calculation method depends on the company's public holiday calendar configuration
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly affects the payroll table's active transactions. Salary proration impacts both first salary calculations and end-of-service settlement amounts.
