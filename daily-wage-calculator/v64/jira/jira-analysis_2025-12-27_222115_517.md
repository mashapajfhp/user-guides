## Glossary

- **Working Days Method**: Standard calculation of 26 working days per month, derived from 365 annual days minus 52 weekly offs, resulting in approximately 26.08 working days per month [Tickets: TSSD-4905, TSSD-3648, TSSD-4292, TSSD-4464, TSSD-1807]
- **Daily Pay Calculation**: Calculated by dividing total monthly salary by 30.41 to determine daily wage rate [Tickets: TSSD-1581]
- **End of Service (EOS) Gratuity**: A financial benefit calculated based on an employee's total service period, typically computed using daily wage and years of service, with specific calculation rules for different service duration brackets. [Tickets: TSSD-4179, TSSD-2605, TSSD-4742, TSSD-1625, TSSD-2252]
- **Leap Year**: A year containing 366 days instead of the standard 365 days, occurring every 4 years (with some exceptions), which requires special handling in date-based calculations. [Tickets: TSSD-4179]
- **Pro-rated Amount**: A proportional salary calculation for partial periods, typically computed by dividing total salary by 30 days and multiplying by days worked [Tickets: TSSD-2605]
- **Monthly Accrual Policy**: Leave days are earned and granted at the end of each month, meaning incomplete months do not generate leave balance. [Tickets: TSSD-4742]
- **Conditional Accrual Policy**: Alternative leave accrual method where leave days are earned daily instead of being granted at month-end. [Tickets: TSSD-4742]
- **Service Duration**: Total number of working days calculated from employment start to departure date, including considerations for leap years [Tickets: TSSD-1625]
- **Gratuity Calculation**: Method of calculating employee's final benefit using daily wage, service duration, and different rates for service periods (21 days per year for first 5 years, 30 days per year after). [Tickets: TSSD-2252, TSSD-2043]
- **Daily Wage Proration**: The method of calculating a proportional daily wage based on the total monthly salary, typically by dividing the monthly salary by a standard number of days (e.g., 30 or 30.42 days). [Tickets: TSSD-2043, TSSD-2321, TSSD-4292, TSSD-4464]
- **Daily Rate Configuration**: A policy setting that determines how daily wage is calculated for leave salary, including the number of days used to divide the monthly salary. [Tickets: TSSD-4731]
- **Prorated Salary**: Partial salary calculation based on actual days worked, typically calculated by dividing monthly salary by total calendar days and multiplying by days worked [Tickets: TSSD-4731, TSSD-3058]
- **Leave Salary Accrual**: Cumulative calculation of vacation leave monetary value, which can vary based on monthly working days configuration [Tickets: TSSD-3648]
- **Leave Salary Calculation**: The process of determining an employee's salary during periods of leave, which may use a different daily wage calculation method than regular salary proration. [Tickets: TSSD-2321]
- **Daily Wage Divisor**: A fixed value of 30.42 used to calculate daily wage by dividing monthly salary, instead of using exact calendar days. [Tickets: TSSD-4368]
