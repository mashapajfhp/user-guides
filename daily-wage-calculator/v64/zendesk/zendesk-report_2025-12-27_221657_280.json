    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the specific leave policy and calendar configuration."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-27\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the specific leave policy and calendar configuration.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control and compliance with regional labor laws. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Allow super admins to configure and customize leave encashment policies for end-of-service calculations, including selection of salary components and calculation methods.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator settings.

If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and resave the proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. The number of days can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if following calendar days leave policy or working days (e.g., 22 days) if following working days leave policy. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible, commonly set to 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). The Daily Wage Calculation impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are calendar days, working days, or custom days. Super admins can configure specific leave types for end-of-service calculations. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated daily and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected when configuring the policy [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted, Super admin must reject existing transactions before saving new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation varies by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation bases produce different daily wage rates and impact final wage amounts for proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by their Daily Wage Calculator configurations to prevent unintended policy changes. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Multiple calculation method options (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and day type options (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days) are available; selection impacts how daily deductions are computed [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must manually reject those transactions before saving changes to salary proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and connects with leave management systems to process approved unpaid leave requests and employee record systems.
