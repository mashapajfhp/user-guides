  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-27  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the specific leave policy and calendar configuration.

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee before daily pay deduction is calculated and reflected on the payroll table.
- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator settings.
- Access to Leave Settings configuration as a Super Admin; ability to add a new leave policy
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days in the month, leave policy type (calendar days or working days), and public holidays falling in the month.
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and choice of salary components to include (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Salary components selection (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment configuration.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, calculated daily pay rate, and deduction reflected on the payroll table.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and determines which salary components and calculation methods apply to leave encashment.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation method applied to the leave policy for monthly payroll processing
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days to arrive at actual working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary amount by actual working days, and generate automatic payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to factor into the calculations.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types eligible for encashment in end-of-service calculations.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). Save changes. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and resave the proration settings.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. The number of days can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if following calendar days leave policy or working days (e.g., 22 days) if following working days leave policy. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation.
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible, commonly set to 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). The Daily Wage Calculation impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction.
- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are calendar days, working days, or custom days. Super admins can configure specific leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated daily and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected when configuring the policy
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted, Super admin must reject existing transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22 days.
- Calendar days calculation varies by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation bases produce different daily wage rates and impact final wage amounts for proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by their Daily Wage Calculator configurations to prevent unintended policy changes.
- Multiple calculation method options (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and day type options (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days) are available; selection impacts how daily deductions are computed
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must manually reject those transactions before saving changes to salary proration settings.

### Feature interactions and dependencies
