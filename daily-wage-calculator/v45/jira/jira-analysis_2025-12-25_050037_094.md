## Known Issue

### Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation

**Statement:** System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were incorrectly based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in payroll calculation discrepancies.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_001 | playwright=NO | test_data=YES | limitation_type=calculation_bug | blocker=ASYNC_RECALC_OR_TXN_LIFECYCLE

### Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation

**Statement:** Global daily rate configuration overrides policy-specific leave calculation settings. System calculates unpaid leave deductions using a global daily rate that takes precedence over individual policy configurations, potentially leading to incorrect salary deductions.

### Duplicate Payroll Deductions After Leave Recalculation

**Statement:** When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Moving the leave request back to pending/accepted does not resolve the issue. Even after deleting the unpaid leave request entirely, the unpaid leave deduction persists in payroll deductions.

### Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees

**Statement:** The daily wage calculator fails to correctly prorate salary when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing. The system only correctly prorates salaries when departure dates are in the past.

### End of Service Gratuity Calculation Incorrect for Leap Years

**Statement:** The system incorrectly calculates service days by using 365 days instead of 366 days for 2024, resulting in an inaccurate gratuity amount. The calculation fails to dynamically adjust for leap years, causing potential underpayment of employee benefits.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_005 | playwright=YES | ui=YES | test_data=YES | limitation_type=calculation_bug

### Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Inconsistency

**Statement:** When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, the daily wage calculation becomes inconsistent between Time Off and Payroll modules. The system cannot recalculate deductions retroactively, causing mismatched salary deduction amounts.

### Lack of Automated Salary Calculation

**Statement:** The current Bayzat payroll system lacks automated salary calculation based on precise working days. The platform cannot dynamically adjust salaries proportionally when employees work more or fewer than the standard 26 working days.

### Incorrect Daily Rate Month Display

**Statement:** The system shows the daily rate from the payroll processing month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate is from the wrong month.

### Inconsistent Days Calculation in Gratuity Computation

**Statement:** Platform calculates days worked with a potential extra day (622 vs 623 days), impacting gratuity calculation precision. The system uses a fixed 30-day divisor for daily wage, which may not align with all client calculation preferences.

- Fallback: locate by visible text labels and section headings

### Daily Wage Divisor Configuration

**Statement:** System calculates leave salary based on predefined policy configuration, which may not align with user expectations about calendar days. The daily wage is divided by a configured number of days (30 vs 31), potentially causing salary calculation differences.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_010 | playwright=NO | test_data=YES | limitation_type=configuration_problem | blocker=BACKEND_ORACLE_REQUIRED

**Selector hints:**
- Prefer data-testid selectors (or stable automation IDs) where available
- Fallback: locate by visible text labels and section headings

### Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Error

**Statement:** End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals.

### Inconsistent Daily Wage Formula Between Leave Policy and Payroll

**Statement:** The daily wage calculator in payroll settings overrides the formula in the leave policy for unpaid leave. The system displays a greyed-out formula in the leave policy, indicating that the payroll settings take precedence. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_012 | playwright=YES | ui=YES | limitation_type=ux_issue

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-2648

- Fallback: locate by visible text labels and section headings

### Leave Salary Accrual Calculation Inconsistency

**Statement:** The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. The daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_013 | playwright=YES | test_data=YES | limitation_type=configuration_problem

### Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Confusion

**Statement:** The system uses a custom daily wage divisor (30.42 days) instead of calendar days, which can produce deduction amounts that differ from user expectations, potentially causing confusion about calculation methods.

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-4368

**Preconditions:**
- Prepare test data to reproduce the scenario described by the ticket(s)

**Steps:**
- Log in as a user who can access the feature (admin if required)
- Navigate to the feature area relevant to this claim

**Expected:**
- Result is observable (in UI or logs) and consistent with the claim statement

**Selector hints:**
- Prefer data-testid selectors (or stable automation IDs) where available
- Fallback: locate by visible text labels and section headings

### EOS Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy

**Statement:** System gratuity calculation differs slightly from manual calculations due to complex service duration and daily wage formula. Calculation involves splitting service duration into different periods with varying daily rates (21 days per year for first 5 years, 30 days per year after 5 years).

### Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy with Leap Year Days

**Statement:** The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently handle leap year days (February 29th), causing minor discrepancies in total service days and resulting gratuity amount. The system calculated 912 days, while manual calculation included 913 days by explicitly counting the leap day.
