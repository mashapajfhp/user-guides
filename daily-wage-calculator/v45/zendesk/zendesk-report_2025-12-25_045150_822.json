    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes daily pay rates for employees taking unpaid leave by dividing total salary (basic plus allowances) by the actual working days in a month. It deducts public holidays from the working day count to ensure accurate salary reductions. When unpaid leave is approved, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. The calculator supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies, adapting the calculation method according to organizational policy. This feature ensures consistent and accurate salary deductions for unpaid leave across the payroll system."

The article clarifies that actual working days are determined by subtracting public holidays from the total working days specified in the organization's leave policy (either calendar days or working days). Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, an automatic pay deduction is created and reflected on the payroll table using the calculated daily pay rate."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes daily pay rates for employees taking unpaid leave by dividing total salary (basic plus allowances) by the actual working days in a month. It deducts public holidays from the working day count to ensure accurate salary reductions. When unpaid leave is approved, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. The calculator supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies, adapting the calculation method according to organizational policy. This feature ensures consistent and accurate salary deductions for unpaid leave across the payroll system.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and automatically deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays.

The number of days used in calculation depends on leave policy: either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 working days) ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days for calculation ; Only the basic salary and allowances are included in the daily pay calculation; other salary components are excluded [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are limited to three types: calendar days (all days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). ; When using working days calculation base, the system automatically excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Salary component selection is limited to three options: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. ; The Daily Wage Calculator impacts only three specific payroll areas: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration settings will affect all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new salary proration changes [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be explicitly subtracted from working days; failure to account for public holidays results in incorrect daily pay calculation. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in December and the policy is 22 working days, daily pay must be calculated on 20 days, not 22. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar day calculations vary by month length (e.g., January has 31 days, February has 28 days), which directly affects the calculated daily wage rate and resulting salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts. ; Different calculation methods (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) can produce significantly different daily wage rates and final payment amounts; selection must align with company policy and regional labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then resave the salary proration changes to ensure consistency [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- Integrates with leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and trigger automatic calculations ; Integrates with payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table ; Depends on employee records system to retrieve salary information (basic + allowances) ; Depends on calendar/holiday management system to identify public holidays for the calculation month [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the public holiday calendar to exclude public holidays when the working days calculation base is selected. ; The Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations throughout the payroll system.
