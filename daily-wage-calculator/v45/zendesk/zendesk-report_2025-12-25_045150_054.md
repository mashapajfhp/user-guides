  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-25  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes daily pay rates for employees taking unpaid leave by dividing total salary (basic plus allowances) by the actual working days in a month. It deducts public holidays from the working day count to ensure accurate salary reductions. When unpaid leave is approved, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. The calculator supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies, adapting the calculation method according to organizational policy. This feature ensures consistent and accurate salary deductions for unpaid leave across the payroll system.

## Knowledge Extract

### Job to be done

- Calculate and automatically deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays.
- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control and alignment to company policies and regional labor laws.
- To adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement by selecting appropriate calculation bases (custom days, calendar days, or working days)

### Primary personas

- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave requests and salary calculations
- Superadmin, Payroll table managers, and transaction processors who configure and manage daily wage calculation settings.
- Super admin

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Creation → Payroll Table Reflection — _The workflow begins when an unpaid leave request is approved, triggering automatic pay deduction generation and display on the payroll table._
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point to the Daily Wage Calculator feature where users configure calculation bases and salary components. | Primary navigation path to access salary proration configuration settings_

### Prerequisites

- Unpaid leave request must be approved before daily pay calculation and deduction is initiated ; Organization must have a defined leave policy specifying either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the basis for calculation
- User must have Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator. ; Company must have a configured public holiday calendar to accurately exclude public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount ; Number of actual working days or calendar days in the month ; Public holidays falling within the month — _Sum of basic salary and allowances; used as the numerator in daily pay calculation ; Determined by the organization's leave policy; can be calendar days (30) or working days (22 or other) ; Public holidays are subtracted from working days to determine actual working days for calculation_
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components selection — _User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (total days in the month), working days (business days excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined number of days, commonly 30 in UAE and KSA). ; User must choose which salary components to include in the calculation: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only._
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days to determine how salary is prorated_

### Outputs and results

- Calculated daily pay rate ; Automatic pay deduction reflected on payroll table — _Result of dividing total salary (basic + allowance) by actual working days; used as the deduction amount per unpaid leave day ; Upon approval of unpaid leave, a pay deduction associated with the specific request is automatically created and displayed on the payroll table_
- Calculated daily wage rates — _The system generates daily wage rates that are applied to three payroll functions: salary proration (adjusting salary for partial months), leave encashment (calculating payment for accrued leave), and unpaid leave deduction (determining deductions for unpaid leave taken)._
- Updated salary calculations — _Salary proration changes are applied to all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table, proportionally adjusting employee compensation based on the selected calculation method_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** — _When an unpaid leave request has been approved and a salary deduction must be calculated and applied_
  - Receive and approve unpaid leave request
  - Identify the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days)
  - Determine the total number of days in the policy (e.g., 30 calendar days or 22 working days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling in the month
  - Subtract public holidays from the total working days to calculate actual working days
  - Calculate daily pay using formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Actual Working Days
  - Automatically generate pay deduction on payroll table based on calculated daily pay and number of unpaid leave days
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up or modifying how daily wages are calculated for payroll processing, leave management, and salary adjustments._
  - Navigate to Settings menu
  - Select Payroll option
  - Click on Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select the calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
  - Choose salary components to include (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only)
  - Save configuration
- **Update Salary Proration Settings** — _When Super admin needs to change how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked_
  - Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation
  - Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days)
  - Save changes
  - If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions before saving new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay formula is: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month ; The number of days used in calculation depends on leave policy: either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 working days) ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days for calculation ; Only the basic salary and allowances are included in the daily pay calculation; other salary components are excluded
- Calculation base options are limited to three types: calendar days (all days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). ; When using working days calculation base, the system automatically excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Salary component selection is limited to three options: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. ; The Daily Wage Calculator impacts only three specific payroll areas: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction.
- Changes to salary proration settings will affect all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new salary proration changes

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be explicitly subtracted from working days; failure to account for public holidays results in incorrect daily pay calculation. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in December and the policy is 22 working days, daily pay must be calculated on 20 days, not 22.
- Calendar day calculations vary by month length (e.g., January has 31 days, February has 28 days), which directly affects the calculated daily wage rate and resulting salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts. ; Different calculation methods (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) can produce significantly different daily wage rates and final payment amounts; selection must align with company policy and regional labor law requirements.
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then resave the salary proration changes to ensure consistency

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Integrates with leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and trigger automatic calculations ; Integrates with payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table ; Depends on employee records system to retrieve salary information (basic + allowances) ; Depends on calendar/holiday management system to identify public holidays for the calculation month
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the public holiday calendar to exclude public holidays when the working days calculation base is selected. ; The Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations throughout the payroll system.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly affects active payroll table transactions, particularly impacting first salary calculations and end-of-service settlements
