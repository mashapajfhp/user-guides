  "feature_description": "The Daily Wage Calculator is a sophisticated payroll management feature designed to automatically calculate and deduct salary for employees taking unpaid leave. By leveraging flexible leave policies, the system can compute daily pay rates using either calendar days or working days, providing HR administrators with a precise mechanism for salary adjustments. The calculator dynamically determines working days by subtracting public holidays from the total monthly days, ensuring accurate and fair compensation calculations. Employees taking unpaid leave will have their salary proportionally reduced based on a mathematical formula that divides total salary by actual working days. This automated process eliminates manual calculation errors and streamlines payroll processing by generating automatic deductions directly in the payroll table. The feature supports multiple leave policy configurations, accommodating different organizational approaches to tracking work and leave periods. By integrating seamlessly with leave management and payroll systems, the Daily Wage Calculator provides a transparent and systematic approach to handling unpaid leave salary deductions. Ultimately, the tool enhances payroll accuracy, reduces administrative overhead, and ensures consistent application of leave and compensation policies across the organization. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation across various scenarios. By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the feature enables payroll managers to adapt wage computations to specific organizational policies and labor regulations. The calculator allows users to select different salary components for inclusion, such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, creating a highly customizable wage determination process. Companies can now more accurately handle salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions with enhanced precision and compliance. Particularly relevant for regions like UAE and KSA, the tool supports labor law alignment by enabling 30-day month calculations and excluding weekends and public holidays as needed. The system provides granular control over wage calculations, reducing manual computational errors and standardizing payroll processes across different employee categories. By integrating with existing payroll and leave management systems, the Daily Wage Calculator streamlines complex compensation calculations and supports more transparent employee payment practices. This feature represents a significant advancement in payroll technology, offering unprecedented flexibility and accuracy in daily wage computations. Salary Proration is a sophisticated payroll management feature designed to calculate employee compensation proportionally based on actual days worked. The system allows super administrators to flexibly adjust salary calculations using different computation methods such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. By providing granular control over wage calculations, this feature ensures precise compensation for employees during partial work periods, such as their first month of employment or final month of service. The Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) enables administrators to select appropriate calculation bases that reflect the organization's specific compensation policies. Changes made to salary proration settings dynamically impact all active, unpaid amounts in the payroll table, ensuring real-time accuracy in financial processing. When payroll months are open and prorated salary transactions exist, super admins can manually manage and adjust these entries to maintain payroll integrity. This feature ultimately supports fair and transparent compensation practices by allowing organizations to proportionally adjust salaries based on actual work performed.",

By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the feature enables payroll managers to adapt wage computations to specific organizational policies and labor regulations. The calculator allows users to select different salary components for inclusion, such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, creating a highly customizable wage determination process. Companies can now more accurately handle salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions with enhanced precision and compliance. Particularly relevant for regions like UAE and KSA, the tool supports labor law alignment by enabling 30-day month calculations and excluding weekends and public holidays as needed. The system provides granular control over wage calculations, reducing manual computational errors and standardizing payroll processes across different employee categories. By integrating with existing payroll and leave management systems, the Daily Wage Calculator streamlines complex compensation calculations and supports more transparent employee payment practices. This feature represents a significant advancement in payroll technology, offering unprecedented flexibility and accuracy in daily wage computations.",

The system allows super administrators to flexibly adjust salary calculations using different computation methods such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. By providing granular control over wage calculations, this feature ensures precise compensation for employees during partial work periods, such as their first month of employment or final month of service. The Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) enables administrators to select appropriate calculation bases that reflect the organization's specific compensation policies. Changes made to salary proration settings dynamically impact all active, unpaid amounts in the payroll table, ensuring real-time accuracy in financial processing. When payroll months are open and prorated salary transactions exist, super admins can manually manage and adjust these entries to maintain payroll integrity. This feature ultimately supports fair and transparent compensation practices by allowing organizations to proportionally adjust salaries based on actual work performed.",
