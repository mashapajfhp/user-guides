  "feature_name": "Daily Wage Calculator",
  "feature_description": "The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll management feature designed to systematically calculate and deduct employee pay for unpaid leave periods. It provides a precise mechanism for reducing salary based on the number of days an employee is absent without pay, considering either calendar or working day leave policies. The system automatically processes unpaid leave requests by determining the appropriate daily pay rate through a standardized calculation method that divides total salary by actual working days in a month. Public holidays are intelligently factored into the calculation, ensuring accurate salary deductions by subtracting holiday periods from the total working days. This feature supports HR personnel and payroll administrators in maintaining transparent and consistent salary adjustments for employees taking unpaid leave. By automating the complex process of prorating salaries, the Daily Wage Calculator reduces manual calculation errors and streamlines payroll processing. The flexible calculation method accommodates different organizational leave policies, whether based on calendar days or working days, making it adaptable to various workplace requirements. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation under various scenarios. By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the system enables payroll managers to adapt wage calculations to specific organizational needs and labor law requirements. The calculator allows users to select different salary components for computation, such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, enhancing its versatility for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. Particularly useful for companies in regions like UAE and KSA, the tool supports compliance with local labor regulations by enabling a standard 30-day calculation method. The system intelligently handles variations in monthly day counts, excluding weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation, thus providing a nuanced approach to wage determination. By centralizing these calculations within the payroll settings, the tool reduces manual computation errors and streamlines complex compensation processes. Accessible to superadmins, payroll table managers, and transaction processors, the Daily Wage Calculator represents a sophisticated solution for modern, flexible payroll management. The feature ultimately empowers organizations to implement precise, customizable, and legally compliant wage calculations with minimal administrative overhead. Salary Proration is a sophisticated payroll management feature that enables precise, proportional salary calculations based on actual days worked. The system allows super administrators to dynamically adjust employee compensation by selecting different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. This functionality is particularly crucial for handling first-time salary payments and end-of-service settlements, ensuring employees receive accurate compensation proportional to their actual work period. By providing flexible calculation methods, organizations can accommodate diverse employment scenarios like partial month employment, sabbaticals, or intermittent work arrangements. The feature integrates seamlessly with the Daily Wage Calculator (DWC), giving payroll managers granular control over salary computations. Super administrators can modify proration settings in the payroll system, with changes immediately affecting all active, unpaid payroll transactions. When changes are made during an open payroll month, administrators must carefully manage existing prorated salary transactions by rejecting and resaving them. This meticulous approach ensures precise financial accounting and transparent compensation management.",

It provides a precise mechanism for reducing salary based on the number of days an employee is absent without pay, considering either calendar or working day leave policies. The system automatically processes unpaid leave requests by determining the appropriate daily pay rate through a standardized calculation method that divides total salary by actual working days in a month. Public holidays are intelligently factored into the calculation, ensuring accurate salary deductions by subtracting holiday periods from the total working days. This feature supports HR personnel and payroll administrators in maintaining transparent and consistent salary adjustments for employees taking unpaid leave.

The flexible calculation method accommodates different organizational leave policies, whether based on calendar days or working days, making it adaptable to various workplace requirements.",

By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the system enables payroll managers to adapt wage calculations to specific organizational needs and labor law requirements. The calculator allows users to select different salary components for computation, such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, enhancing its versatility for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. Particularly useful for companies in regions like UAE and KSA, the tool supports compliance with local labor regulations by enabling a standard 30-day calculation method. The system intelligently handles variations in monthly day counts, excluding weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation, thus providing a nuanced approach to wage determination. By centralizing these calculations within the payroll settings, the tool reduces manual computation errors and streamlines complex compensation processes. Accessible to superadmins, payroll table managers, and transaction processors, the Daily Wage Calculator represents a sophisticated solution for modern, flexible payroll management. The feature ultimately empowers organizations to implement precise, customizable, and legally compliant wage calculations with minimal administrative overhead.",

The system allows super administrators to dynamically adjust employee compensation by selecting different calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. This functionality is particularly crucial for handling first-time salary payments and end-of-service settlements, ensuring employees receive accurate compensation proportional to their actual work period. By providing flexible calculation methods, organizations can accommodate diverse employment scenarios like partial month employment, sabbaticals, or intermittent work arrangements. The feature integrates seamlessly with the Daily Wage Calculator (DWC), giving payroll managers granular control over salary computations. Super administrators can modify proration settings in the payroll system, with changes immediately affecting all active, unpaid payroll transactions. When changes are made during an open payroll month, administrators must carefully manage existing prorated salary transactions by rejecting and resaving them. This meticulous approach ensures precise financial accounting and transparent compensation management.",
