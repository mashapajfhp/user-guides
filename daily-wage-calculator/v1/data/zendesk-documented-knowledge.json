  "feature_name": "Daily Wage Calculator",
  "feature_description": "The Daily Wage Calculator is a payroll system functionality designed to automatically calculate and deduct salary for employees taking unpaid leave. This feature provides a systematic approach to determining precise salary reductions by dividing an employee's total monthly salary (basic plus allowances) by the actual number of working days in a given month. The calculation considers two potential leave policies: calendar days (30 days) or working days (typically 22 days), with a critical mechanism for subtracting public holidays from the total working days. By integrating leave management with payroll systems, the feature ensures accurate and transparent salary adjustments when employees take approved unpaid leave. The automated process eliminates manual calculation errors and provides HR personnel with a standardized method for handling salary deductions. The system dynamically adjusts working days based on official holiday calendars, ensuring fair and consistent pay calculations across different months and employee groups. Ultimately, this feature supports precise financial management and maintains clear communication about salary adjustments related to unpaid time off. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation on a daily basis. Previously constrained by limited calculation options, this feature now enables payroll managers to select from multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, or custom days, addressing complex salary prorations and leave management scenarios. The calculator allows users to choose specific salary components for calculation, such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, offering unprecedented customization in wage computation. Particularly valuable for companies in regions like UAE and KSA, the tool supports labor law compliance by enabling 30-day month calculations and handling nuanced scenarios like leave encashment and unpaid leave deductions. By providing granular control over daily wage calculations, the feature helps organizations maintain accurate and fair compensation practices across different employment contexts. The system intelligently manages variations in month lengths, excludes weekends and public holidays when required, and supports different organizational payroll policies. Accessible through a straightforward Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation pathway, the tool empowers payroll professionals with a robust, flexible solution for precise wage computations. Ultimately, the Daily Wage Calculator represents a significant advancement in payroll technology, transforming how organizations approach daily rate calculations with greater accuracy and administrative efficiency. Salary Proration is a sophisticated payroll management feature designed to precisely calculate employee compensation based on actual days worked. The system allows super administrators to dynamically adjust salary calculations using multiple calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. By enabling granular control over wage computation, this feature ensures accurate financial compensation during an employee's first salary period or end-of-service settlement. The mechanism provides flexibility in handling partial month employment scenarios, allowing organizations to proportionally adjust compensation based on specific organizational requirements. Super administrators can navigate through the Daily Wage Calculator to modify proration settings, which immediately impacts active payroll transactions. The feature requires careful management, particularly during open payroll months, where existing prorated salary transactions must be manually reviewed and potentially rejected before implementing new proration settings. This approach ensures precise, transparent, and adaptable salary calculations that align with complex workforce management needs. Ultimately, Salary Proration represents a critical tool for maintaining payroll accuracy and fairness across varying employment scenarios.",

      "feature_description": "The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation on a daily basis. Previously constrained by limited calculation options, this feature now enables payroll managers to select from multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, or custom days, addressing complex salary prorations and leave management scenarios. The calculator allows users to choose specific salary components for calculation, such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, offering unprecedented customization in wage computation. Particularly valuable for companies in regions like UAE and KSA, the tool supports labor law compliance by enabling 30-day month calculations and handling nuanced scenarios like leave encashment and unpaid leave deductions. By providing granular control over daily wage calculations, the feature helps organizations maintain accurate and fair compensation practices across different employment contexts. The system intelligently manages variations in month lengths, excludes weekends and public holidays when required, and supports different organizational payroll policies. Accessible through a straightforward Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation pathway, the tool empowers payroll professionals with a robust, flexible solution for precise wage computations. Ultimately, the Daily Wage Calculator represents a significant advancement in payroll technology, transforming how organizations approach daily rate calculations with greater accuracy and administrative efficiency.",

The system allows super administrators to dynamically adjust salary calculations using multiple calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. By enabling granular control over wage computation, this feature ensures accurate financial compensation during an employee's first salary period or end-of-service settlement. The mechanism provides flexibility in handling partial month employment scenarios, allowing organizations to proportionally adjust compensation based on specific organizational requirements. Super administrators can navigate through the Daily Wage Calculator to modify proration settings, which immediately impacts active payroll transactions. The feature requires careful management, particularly during open payroll months, where existing prorated salary transactions must be manually reviewed and potentially rejected before implementing new proration settings. This approach ensures precise, transparent, and adaptable salary calculations that align with complex workforce management needs. Ultimately, Salary Proration represents a critical tool for maintaining payroll accuracy and fairness across varying employment scenarios.",
