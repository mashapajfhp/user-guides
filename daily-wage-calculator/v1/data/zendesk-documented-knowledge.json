  "feature_description": "The Daily Wage Calculator is a sophisticated payroll system feature designed to automatically calculate and deduct salary for employees taking unpaid leave. By providing a precise mechanism to determine daily pay rates, the system enables HR personnel to manage salary adjustments based on either calendar or working days leave policies. The calculation methodology involves dividing an employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the actual number of working days in a month, accounting for public holidays and approved leave periods. This automated approach ensures accurate and transparent salary deductions, reducing manual calculation errors and streamlining payroll processing. The feature supports flexible leave policies by allowing organizations to choose between calendar day (30 days) or working day (typically 22 days) calculations. Public holidays are intelligently subtracted from working days to provide a granular and fair approach to salary reduction. By integrating directly with payroll systems, the Daily Wage Calculator generates automatic deductions that are immediately reflected in employee compensation records. This system not only simplifies complex payroll computations but also provides a standardized, rules-based approach to managing unpaid leave financial implications. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation across various scenarios. By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the tool enables payroll managers to adapt wage calculations to specific organizational policies and labor regulations. The calculator allows users to select different salary components for computation, such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, providing unprecedented granularity in wage determination. Organizations can now handle complex payroll scenarios like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions with greater accuracy and customization. Particularly beneficial for companies in regions like UAE and KSA, the tool supports compliance with local labor laws by allowing configurations like 30-day month calculations. Accessible through a straightforward navigation path in the system's settings, the Daily Wage Calculator empowers payroll professionals to implement precise, context-specific wage calculations. The tool significantly reduces manual computation errors and provides a standardized approach to handling variable pay scenarios across different employee categories and employment contexts. Salary Proration is a sophisticated payroll management feature designed to precisely calculate employee compensation based on actual days worked. The system enables super administrators to dynamically adjust salary calculations using flexible calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. By providing granular control over wage computation, organizations can accurately compensate employees who join mid-month, leave during a pay period, or have variable work schedules. The feature integrates directly with the Daily Wage Calculator (DWC), allowing seamless adjustments that impact both initial salary payments and end-of-service settlements. Super administrators can modify proration settings through a structured workflow in the payroll settings, ensuring precise and fair compensation calculations. When changes are made, the system automatically updates all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table, maintaining real-time accuracy. The feature also includes safeguards for open payroll months, requiring administrators to manually reject and resave existing prorated transactions to prevent calculation discrepancies. This sophisticated approach to salary calculation supports complex workforce management scenarios while maintaining financial precision and administrative flexibility.",

The system enables super administrators to dynamically adjust salary calculations using flexible calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. By providing granular control over wage computation, organizations can accurately compensate employees who join mid-month, leave during a pay period, or have variable work schedules. The feature integrates directly with the Daily Wage Calculator (DWC), allowing seamless adjustments that impact both initial salary payments and end-of-service settlements. Super administrators can modify proration settings through a structured workflow in the payroll settings, ensuring precise and fair compensation calculations. When changes are made, the system automatically updates all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table, maintaining real-time accuracy. The feature also includes safeguards for open payroll months, requiring administrators to manually reject and resave existing prorated transactions to prevent calculation discrepancies. This sophisticated approach to salary calculation supports complex workforce management scenarios while maintaining financial precision and administrative flexibility.",
