  "feature_name": "Daily Wage Calculator",
  "feature_description": "The Daily Wage Calculator is a sophisticated payroll management feature designed to automatically calculate and deduct salary for employees taking unpaid leave. By leveraging flexible calculation methods, the system can compute daily pay rates using either calendar days or working days, providing HR personnel with a precise mechanism for salary adjustments. The calculator dynamically accounts for public holidays, ensuring accurate working day calculations by subtracting holiday periods from the total monthly work period. When an employee's unpaid leave is approved, the system automatically generates a targeted pay deduction based on a proportional daily rate calculation, which divides the employee's total salary (basic + allowances) by the actual number of working days. This intelligent approach allows organizations to maintain payroll accuracy while accommodating employee leave policies with computational precision. The feature supports seamless integration with existing payroll systems, enabling automatic deduction reflection and minimizing manual administrative overhead. By standardizing unpaid leave salary calculations, the Daily Wage Calculator helps organizations maintain transparent and consistent compensation management practices. The system's flexibility in handling different leave policies makes it adaptable to various organizational compensation structures and regulatory requirements. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation for partial work periods. By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the feature enables payroll managers to customize wage computations according to specific organizational needs and labor regulations. The calculator allows users to select different salary components for inclusion, such as basic salary, allowances, or combined options, which enhances the accuracy of salary prorations. Companies can now handle complex scenarios like leave encashment, unpaid leave deductions, and salary adjustments with greater granularity and control. Particularly relevant for regions like UAE and KSA, the tool supports compliance with local labor laws by enabling 30-day month calculations. The system intelligently handles variations in month lengths and can exclude weekends and public holidays from calculations, providing a sophisticated approach to wage determination. By centralizing these calculations within the payroll settings, the feature reduces manual computation errors and streamlines administrative processes. Ultimately, the Daily Wage Calculator represents a significant advancement in payroll technology, offering unprecedented flexibility and precision in employee compensation management. Salary Proration is a sophisticated payroll management feature designed to calculate employee compensation proportionally based on actual days worked. The system allows super administrators to dynamically adjust salary calculations using flexible calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. By providing granular control over wage computation, organizations can precisely track and compensate employees for partial work periods, including their initial employment month and final service settlement. The feature integrates directly with the Daily Wage Calculator (DWC), enabling administrators to make real-time adjustments that immediately impact active payroll transactions. When changes are implemented, the system requires careful management, particularly during open payroll months where existing prorated salary transactions must be manually rejected and reset. This approach ensures accurate, transparent, and adaptable compensation calculation that aligns with diverse organizational payroll policies and employment scenarios. The proration mechanism supports fair and precise financial processing, reducing manual calculation errors and providing flexibility in handling complex wage computation requirements.",

By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the feature enables payroll managers to customize wage computations according to specific organizational needs and labor regulations. The calculator allows users to select different salary components for inclusion, such as basic salary, allowances, or combined options, which enhances the accuracy of salary prorations. Companies can now handle complex scenarios like leave encashment, unpaid leave deductions, and salary adjustments with greater granularity and control. Particularly relevant for regions like UAE and KSA, the tool supports compliance with local labor laws by enabling 30-day month calculations. The system intelligently handles variations in month lengths and can exclude weekends and public holidays from calculations, providing a sophisticated approach to wage determination. By centralizing these calculations within the payroll settings, the feature reduces manual computation errors and streamlines administrative processes. Ultimately, the Daily Wage Calculator represents a significant advancement in payroll technology, offering unprecedented flexibility and precision in employee compensation management.",

      "feature_description": "Salary Proration is a sophisticated payroll management feature designed to calculate employee compensation proportionally based on actual days worked. The system allows super administrators to dynamically adjust salary calculations using flexible calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. By providing granular control over wage computation, organizations can precisely track and compensate employees for partial work periods, including their initial employment month and final service settlement. The feature integrates directly with the Daily Wage Calculator (DWC), enabling administrators to make real-time adjustments that immediately impact active payroll transactions. When changes are implemented, the system requires careful management, particularly during open payroll months where existing prorated salary transactions must be manually rejected and reset. This approach ensures accurate, transparent, and adaptable compensation calculation that aligns with diverse organizational payroll policies and employment scenarios. The proration mechanism supports fair and precise financial processing, reducing manual calculation errors and providing flexibility in handling complex wage computation requirements.",
