  "feature_description": "The Daily Wage Calculator is a sophisticated payroll management feature designed to accurately calculate salary deductions for unpaid leave. It provides a systematic approach to determining an employee's daily pay rate by dividing their total monthly salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a given month. The system offers flexibility by supporting two leave policy calculation methods: calendar days (30 days) or working days (typically 22 days). A critical component of the calculation is the intelligent handling of public holidays, which are automatically subtracted from the total working days to ensure precise salary reduction. When an employee's unpaid leave is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is directly reflected in the payroll table. This feature streamlines the complex process of leave and salary management, reducing manual calculation errors and providing transparency in how unpaid leave impacts an employee's compensation. By considering nuanced factors like public holidays and different leave policy approaches, the Daily Wage Calculator ensures fair and accurate salary adjustments. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation on a daily basis. By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the system allows payroll managers to adapt wage calculations to specific organizational needs and labor regulations. Users can customize the calculation by selecting different salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, enabling nuanced and accurate wage prorations. The calculator addresses critical payroll scenarios like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, which previously lacked comprehensive computational flexibility. Particularly relevant for companies in regions like UAE and KSA, the tool supports compliance with local labor laws by allowing configurations like 30-day month calculations. Accessible through a straightforward navigation path of Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation, the feature empowers payroll professionals to handle complex wage computations with greater precision and control. By accounting for variations like weekends, public holidays, and diverse salary structures, the Daily Wage Calculator represents a significant advancement in payroll management technology. The system's adaptability ensures that organizations can implement wage calculations that are both legally compliant and tailored to their unique operational requirements. Salary proration is a sophisticated payroll management feature designed to calculate employee compensation proportionally based on actual days worked. The system allows super administrators to dynamically adjust salary calculations using flexible calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. By enabling precise wage computation, this feature ensures fair and accurate compensation for employees during partial pay periods, particularly impacting their first salary and end-of-service settlement. The Daily Wage Calculator provides granular control, allowing administrators to select the most appropriate calculation method for their organizational needs. When changes are made, the system automatically updates all active, unpaid amounts in the payroll table, ensuring real-time accuracy. Super administrators have the ability to modify proration settings and can manually manage existing transactions when the payroll month is open. This feature addresses the complex challenge of prorating salaries by offering a configurable, transparent approach to wage calculation that adapts to various employment scenarios. Ultimately, salary proration supports precise financial management and helps organizations maintain equitable compensation practices.",

It provides a systematic approach to determining an employee's daily pay rate by dividing their total monthly salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in a given month. The system offers flexibility by supporting two leave policy calculation methods: calendar days (30 days) or working days (typically 22 days). A critical component of the calculation is the intelligent handling of public holidays, which are automatically subtracted from the total working days to ensure precise salary reduction. When an employee's unpaid leave is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is directly reflected in the payroll table. This feature streamlines the complex process of leave and salary management, reducing manual calculation errors and providing transparency in how unpaid leave impacts an employee's compensation. By considering nuanced factors like public holidays and different leave policy approaches, the Daily Wage Calculator ensures fair and accurate salary adjustments.",

By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the system allows payroll managers to adapt wage calculations to specific organizational needs and labor regulations. Users can customize the calculation by selecting different salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, enabling nuanced and accurate wage prorations. The calculator addresses critical payroll scenarios like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, which previously lacked comprehensive computational flexibility. Particularly relevant for companies in regions like UAE and KSA, the tool supports compliance with local labor laws by allowing configurations like 30-day month calculations. Accessible through a straightforward navigation path of Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation, the feature empowers payroll professionals to handle complex wage computations with greater precision and control. By accounting for variations like weekends, public holidays, and diverse salary structures, the Daily Wage Calculator represents a significant advancement in payroll management technology. The system's adaptability ensures that organizations can implement wage calculations that are both legally compliant and tailored to their unique operational requirements.",

The system allows super administrators to dynamically adjust salary calculations using flexible calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days. By enabling precise wage computation, this feature ensures fair and accurate compensation for employees during partial pay periods, particularly impacting their first salary and end-of-service settlement. The Daily Wage Calculator provides granular control, allowing administrators to select the most appropriate calculation method for their organizational needs. When changes are made, the system automatically updates all active, unpaid amounts in the payroll table, ensuring real-time accuracy. Super administrators have the ability to modify proration settings and can manually manage existing transactions when the payroll month is open. This feature addresses the complex challenge of prorating salaries by offering a configurable, transparent approach to wage calculation that adapts to various employment scenarios. Ultimately, salary proration supports precise financial management and helps organizations maintain equitable compensation practices.",
