  "feature_name": "Daily Wage Calculator",
  "feature_description": "The Daily Wage Calculator is a sophisticated payroll management feature designed to automatically calculate and deduct salary for employees taking unpaid leave. By leveraging flexible calculation methods, the system can compute daily pay rates using either calendar days or working days, providing HR personnel with precise salary reduction mechanisms. The calculator dynamically adjusts working days by accounting for public holidays, ensuring accurate and fair compensation adjustments. When an employee's unpaid leave is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction based on the calculated daily rate, which is determined by dividing the total salary (basic + allowance) by the actual number of working days. This feature streamlines payroll processing by eliminating manual calculations and reducing potential human error in leave-related salary adjustments. The calculator supports different organizational leave policies, accommodating variations in day-counting methodologies while maintaining consistent and transparent salary deduction processes. By integrating seamlessly with payroll and leave management systems, the Daily Wage Calculator provides a robust solution for managing employee compensation during periods of unpaid absence. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll management tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the feature enables payroll professionals to adapt wage calculations to specific organizational needs and labor regulations. Companies can now customize daily wage computations by selecting different salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, which significantly enhances payroll accuracy and compliance. The calculator addresses three critical payroll scenarios: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, giving organizations greater control over wage calculations. Particularly relevant for businesses in regions like UAE and KSA, the tool allows setting custom day calculations to align with local labor laws, which typically consider a month as 30 days. By excluding weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation, the system provides a more precise representation of actual working time. The feature is accessible to superadmins, payroll table managers, and transaction processors through a straightforward navigation path in the payroll settings. This innovative solution resolves previous limitations in daily rate calculations, offering unprecedented flexibility and customization in wage computation. Salary Proration is a sophisticated payroll management feature designed to calculate employee compensation proportionally based on actual days worked. The system enables super administrators to flexibly adjust salary calculations using different computation methods like custom days, calendar days, or working days. By providing granular control over wage calculation, organizations can precisely compensate employees for partial work periods, such as during their first month of employment or final employment settlement. The feature integrates directly with the Daily Wage Calculator (DWC), allowing seamless adjustments to payroll transactions and ensuring accurate financial representation of an employee's time worked. Super administrators can modify proration settings, which automatically update all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table, creating a dynamic and responsive compensation management process. When changes are made during an open payroll month, administrators must carefully manage existing prorated salary transactions by rejecting and resaving them to maintain system integrity. This approach provides organizations with a robust mechanism to handle complex salary calculations while maintaining transparency and precision in employee compensation.",

By leveraging flexible calculation methods, the system can compute daily pay rates using either calendar days or working days, providing HR personnel with precise salary reduction mechanisms. The calculator dynamically adjusts working days by accounting for public holidays, ensuring accurate and fair compensation adjustments. When an employee's unpaid leave is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction based on the calculated daily rate, which is determined by dividing the total salary (basic + allowance) by the actual number of working days. This feature streamlines payroll processing by eliminating manual calculations and reducing potential human error in leave-related salary adjustments. The calculator supports different organizational leave policies, accommodating variations in day-counting methodologies while maintaining consistent and transparent salary deduction processes. By integrating seamlessly with payroll and leave management systems, the Daily Wage Calculator provides a robust solution for managing employee compensation during periods of unpaid absence.",

By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the feature enables payroll professionals to adapt wage calculations to specific organizational needs and labor regulations. Companies can now customize daily wage computations by selecting different salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, which significantly enhances payroll accuracy and compliance. The calculator addresses three critical payroll scenarios: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, giving organizations greater control over wage calculations. Particularly relevant for businesses in regions like UAE and KSA, the tool allows setting custom day calculations to align with local labor laws, which typically consider a month as 30 days. By excluding weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation, the system provides a more precise representation of actual working time. The feature is accessible to superadmins, payroll table managers, and transaction processors through a straightforward navigation path in the payroll settings. This innovative solution resolves previous limitations in daily rate calculations, offering unprecedented flexibility and customization in wage computation.",

      "feature_description": "Salary Proration is a sophisticated payroll management feature designed to calculate employee compensation proportionally based on actual days worked. The system enables super administrators to flexibly adjust salary calculations using different computation methods like custom days, calendar days, or working days. By providing granular control over wage calculation, organizations can precisely compensate employees for partial work periods, such as during their first month of employment or final employment settlement. The feature integrates directly with the Daily Wage Calculator (DWC), allowing seamless adjustments to payroll transactions and ensuring accurate financial representation of an employee's time worked. Super administrators can modify proration settings, which automatically update all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table, creating a dynamic and responsive compensation management process. When changes are made during an open payroll month, administrators must carefully manage existing prorated salary transactions by rejecting and resaving them to maintain system integrity. This approach provides organizations with a robust mechanism to handle complex salary calculations while maintaining transparency and precision in employee compensation.",
