  "feature_description": "The Daily Wage Calculator is a sophisticated payroll management feature designed to precisely calculate salary deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. By leveraging an automated system, it enables HR personnel to accurately reduce an employee's monthly compensation based on the number of days not worked. The calculator supports two distinct leave policy approaches: calendar days (30-day basis) and working days (typically 22 days), providing flexibility for different organizational policies. Public holidays are intelligently factored into the calculation, ensuring that they are subtracted from the total working days before determining the daily pay rate. The core calculation mechanism divides an employee's total salary (basic pay plus allowances) by the actual number of working days, creating a proportional and fair method for salary adjustment. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a precise pay deduction that is directly reflected in the payroll table. This feature streamlines the complex process of leave management and salary calculation, reducing manual administrative burden and minimizing potential human error in financial computations. By providing a transparent and systematic approach to handling unpaid leave, the Daily Wage Calculator supports accurate and equitable compensation management. The Daily Wage Calculator is an advanced payroll management tool designed to provide organizations with flexible and precise methods for calculating employee compensation. By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the feature enables payroll managers to adapt wage calculations to specific organizational needs and labor regulations. Users can customize calculations by selecting different salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, which enhances the system's adaptability to diverse payroll scenarios. The calculator addresses critical payroll processes like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, thereby streamlining complex compensation computations. Particularly relevant for companies in regions like UAE and KSA, the tool supports labor law compliance by allowing configurations like 30-day month calculations. Accessible through a straightforward navigation path of Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation, the feature empowers payroll professionals with granular control over wage computations. By accounting for variations like weekends, public holidays, and different month lengths, the Daily Wage Calculator provides a robust solution for accurate and flexible salary calculations. The tool represents a significant advancement from traditional limited wage calculation methods, offering unprecedented customization and precision in payroll management. Salary Proration is a payroll management feature designed to calculate employee compensation proportionally based on actual days worked. It provides super administrators with flexible calculation methods including custom days, calendar days, and working days to precisely adjust salary computations. The feature is critical for handling employee first-month salaries and end-of-service settlements, ensuring accurate financial compensation. By allowing granular control over wage calculations, organizations can adapt salary prorations to their specific business rules and employment scenarios. The system enables administrators to modify proration settings dynamically, with changes automatically applying to all active, unpaid payroll amounts. When payroll transactions are already in progress, the feature requires manual intervention to reject existing prorated salary entries before implementing new calculation bases. This approach maintains financial accuracy and provides transparency in compensation management. The Daily Wage Calculator serves as the primary interface for super administrators to configure and manage these sophisticated salary proration settings.",

By leveraging an automated system, it enables HR personnel to accurately reduce an employee's monthly compensation based on the number of days not worked. The calculator supports two distinct leave policy approaches: calendar days (30-day basis) and working days (typically 22 days), providing flexibility for different organizational policies. Public holidays are intelligently factored into the calculation, ensuring that they are subtracted from the total working days before determining the daily pay rate. The core calculation mechanism divides an employee's total salary (basic pay plus allowances) by the actual number of working days, creating a proportional and fair method for salary adjustment. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a precise pay deduction that is directly reflected in the payroll table. This feature streamlines the complex process of leave management and salary calculation, reducing manual administrative burden and minimizing potential human error in financial computations. By providing a transparent and systematic approach to handling unpaid leave, the Daily Wage Calculator supports accurate and equitable compensation management.",

By offering multiple calculation bases including calendar days, working days, and custom days, the feature enables payroll managers to adapt wage calculations to specific organizational needs and labor regulations. Users can customize calculations by selecting different salary components such as basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only, which enhances the system's adaptability to diverse payroll scenarios. The calculator addresses critical payroll processes like salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, thereby streamlining complex compensation computations. Particularly relevant for companies in regions like UAE and KSA, the tool supports labor law compliance by allowing configurations like 30-day month calculations. Accessible through a straightforward navigation path of Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation, the feature empowers payroll professionals with granular control over wage computations. By accounting for variations like weekends, public holidays, and different month lengths, the Daily Wage Calculator provides a robust solution for accurate and flexible salary calculations. The tool represents a significant advancement from traditional limited wage calculation methods, offering unprecedented customization and precision in payroll management.",

It provides super administrators with flexible calculation methods including custom days, calendar days, and working days to precisely adjust salary computations. The feature is critical for handling employee first-month salaries and end-of-service settlements, ensuring accurate financial compensation. By allowing granular control over wage calculations, organizations can adapt salary prorations to their specific business rules and employment scenarios. The system enables administrators to modify proration settings dynamically, with changes automatically applying to all active, unpaid payroll amounts. When payroll transactions are already in progress, the feature requires manual intervention to reject existing prorated salary entries before implementing new calculation bases. This approach maintains financial accuracy and provides transparency in compensation management. The Daily Wage Calculator serves as the primary interface for super administrators to configure and manage these sophisticated salary proration settings.",
