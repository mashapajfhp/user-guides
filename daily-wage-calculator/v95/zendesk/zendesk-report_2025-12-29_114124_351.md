  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-29  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee before daily pay deduction is calculated and reflected on payroll

- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator settings.
- Access to Leave Settings configuration as a Super Admin; ability to add a new leave policy
- Super admin role and access to payroll settings; payroll system must be configured

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days or calendar days in the month based on leave policy, and public holidays falling within the month
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to include (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Salary components selection (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method selection (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment configuration.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, calculated daily pay rate, and deduction reflected on the payroll table
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and determines which salary components and leave types are included in encashment calculations.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation that applies daily rates to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select a calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to factor into the calculations.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select applicable salary components for leave encashment (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types eligible for end-of-service encashment calculations.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of actual working days in the month. Leave policy can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to calculate actual working days used in the formula
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month, e.g., 31 for January, 28 for February), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible, commonly set to 30 in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select the calculation base.
- Salary components are limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation methods are limited to calendar days, working days, or custom days. Super admins can configure specific leave types for encashment eligibility.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected during policy configuration
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be identified and subtracted from the total working days before calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days
- Calculation varies depending on month length when using calendar days (e.g., 31 days in January versus 28 days in February), and different calculation methods can significantly impact final wage calculations for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- Super admins can view which existing eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when applying new Daily Wage Calculator configurations.
- Multiple calculation method options (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and day type options (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days) are available; selection impacts how daily deductions are computed
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings
