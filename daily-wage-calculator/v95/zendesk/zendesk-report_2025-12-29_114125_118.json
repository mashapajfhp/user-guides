    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-29\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, with options to select calculation bases and salary components.

Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of actual working days in the month. Leave policy can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to calculate actual working days used in the formula [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month, e.g., 31 for January, 28 for February), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible, commonly set to 30 in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select the calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary components are limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation methods are limited to calendar days, working days, or custom days. Super admins can configure specific leave types for encashment eligibility. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected during policy configuration [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be identified and subtracted from the total working days before calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation varies depending on month length when using calendar days (e.g., 31 days in January versus 28 days in February), and different calculation methods can significantly impact final wage calculations for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins can view which existing eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when applying new Daily Wage Calculator configurations. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Multiple calculation method options (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and day type options (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days) are available; selection impacts how daily deductions are computed [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- Integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions; interacts with leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and employee record systems to access salary information [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- The Daily Wage Calculator impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It interacts with the company's public holiday calendar and payroll settings. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with payroll settings, end-of-service eligibility configuration, and leave management systems to customize leave encashment policies that affect end-of-service calculations. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Integrates with the payroll system to apply daily unpaid leave deductions to monthly employee pay; works in conjunction with Leave Policies configuration [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Interacts with Payroll system, payroll table (active/unpaid amounts), and affects employee first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Glossary Terms\n- Daily pay: The calculated daily salary amount used for deducting unpaid leave, derived by dividing total salary by actual working days. Actual working days: The number of working days in a month after deducting public holidays.
