  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically creates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table based on the calculated daily pay rate.

- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table and calculated daily pay rate used to determine salary reduction for unpaid leave.

- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations for eligible leave types.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation settings that apply daily deductions to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method (custom days, calendar days, or working days).

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve leave request, determine leave policy type (calendar or working days), calculate total working days, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay rate by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service encashment eligibility.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and resave the new proration settings.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days. The leave policy can use either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation.
- Calculation base options include calendar days (total days in a month, e.g., 31 for January, 28 for February), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible basis set by payroll managers, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select the calculation base.
- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Configuration applies to eligible paid leave types only.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay. Multiple calculation method options are available to provide flexibility in how daily rates are computed
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted, Super admin must reject existing transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a month with 22 working days, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days.
- Calculation results vary depending on month length (e.g., 31 days in January versus 28 days in February), and different calculation bases can produce significantly different daily wage amounts, impacting final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction values.
- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new Daily Wage Calculator configuration.
- Multiple options exist for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, requiring careful selection based on organizational payroll policies
- When payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions for one or multiple employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then save the new salary proration changes to apply them.

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and connects with leave management and employee record systems to process unpaid leave requests.
- The Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It integrates with the company's public holiday calendar and payroll settings.
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service eligibility system, and Leave Management system to customize leave encashment policies that affect end-of-service calculations.
- Interacts with the payroll system by calculating daily deductions that are applied to monthly employee pay; similar to leave encashment configuration
- Interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions; changes impact first salary calculations and end-of-service settlements.
