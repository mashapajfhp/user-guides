    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically creates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table based on the calculated daily pay rate."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically creates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table based on the calculated daily pay rate.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control over calculation methodology. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Allow super admins to configure and customize leave encashment policies for end-of-service calculations, including selection of salary components and calculation methods.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to properly exclude public holidays when using the working days calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- User must have super admin role to access and configure leave encashment policies.

[Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Required Inputs\n- Employee's total salary (basic plus allowance), number of working days in the month, leave policy type (calendar days or working days), and approved unpaid leave days.

[Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days) [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and resave the new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days. The leave policy can use either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options include calendar days (total days in a month, e.g., 31 for January, 28 for February), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible basis set by payroll managers, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select the calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Configuration applies to eligible paid leave types only. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay. Multiple calculation method options are available to provide flexibility in how daily rates are computed [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted, Super admin must reject existing transactions before saving new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a month with 22 working days, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days.
