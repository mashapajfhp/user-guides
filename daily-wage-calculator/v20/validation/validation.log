Perfect! The validation is now complete. Let me create a final summary:

### 🎯 Key Findings

**Primary Configuration Point**:
- Settings > Payroll > Daily Wage Calculation
- 3 services: Salary proration (30.45 days), EOS leave encashment (22 days), Unpaid leave deduction (30 days)

**Override Behavior**:
- Disabled fields in EOS eligibility configuration
- Disabled fields in Leave policy configuration
- Blue alert banners: "Daily rate is configured in daily wage calculation setting"
- Hyperlinks directing users to primary configuration

**UI Patterns**:
- Consistent disabled state styling (gray, non-interactive)
- Clear informational messaging
- Direct navigation links
- Formula display: Component / Calculation = Days

All validation evidence has been captured and documented. The feature demonstrates robust implementation with excellent user communication about configuration hierarchy.
