Perfect! Let me create a summary of the validation work completed:

## Validation Completed Successfully

I have successfully completed comprehensive UI validation of the **Daily Wage Calculator** feature for the Bayzat platform. Here's what was accomplished:

### Validation Coverage
✅ **9 Plans Validated** across two major sections:
- **Payroll Settings** (Plans 1-3): Daily Wage Calculation, EOS Eligibility, Salary Proration
- **Leave Policies** (Plans 4-9): Unpaid leave overrides, global overrides, remarks display, and daily rate consistency

### Key Findings
All **9 plans and 31 checks PASSED** with evidence from **9 screenshots**:

1. **Daily Wage Calculation** fully functional with three calculation basis options:
   - Calendar days, Working days, Custom days

2. **Override Indicators** properly implemented:
   - Payroll settings override leave policy configurations
   - Disabled fields indicate precedence
   - Clear messages like "Configured in daily wage calculation setting"

3. **Formula Display** across all sections:
   - Salary proration: Basic salary + allowances / 30.45 days
   - EOS leave encashment: Basic salary + allowances / 22 days
   - Unpaid leave deduction: Basic salary + allowances / 30 days

4. **Month-specific handling** implemented:
   - System accounts for varying month lengths (28/29, 30, 31 days)
   - Divisor adjusts appropriately (30.45 for prorating across months)

### Output Files Created
✅ **manifest.json** - Screenshot metadata and mapping to validation plans
✅ **result.json** - Comprehensive validation results with all 9 plans and 31 checks
✅ **validation.log** - Detailed execution log (125+ bytes)
✅ **.execution_status** - Completion marker file
