    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system component that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature automatically generates and reflects pay deductions on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. It supports both calendar-day-based and working-day-based leave policies, ensuring accurate salary reductions aligned with organizational leave policies."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-24\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system component that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature automatically generates and reflects pay deductions on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. It supports both calendar-day-based and working-day-based leave policies, ensuring accurate salary reductions aligned with organizational leave policies.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and automatically deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control and accuracy. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement by selecting appropriate calculation bases (custom days, calendar days, or working days).

[Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admin [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Navigation Paths\n- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Creation → Payroll Table Reflection | context: The workflow begins when an unpaid leave request is approved, triggering automatic pay deduction generation and reflection on the payroll system. | [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation | context: Primary access point to configure the Daily Wage Calculator and select calculation bases and salary components. | Primary navigation to access Daily Wage Calculator configuration interface where calculation bases can be selected and saved. | [Articles: 14243704039185, 14243760419089]\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Unpaid leave request must be approved before daily pay deduction is calculated and created. ; Organization must have a defined leave policy (either calendar days or working days based). [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- User must have Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor role to access and configure Daily Wage Calculator settings. ; Company must have a public holiday calendar configured to use working days calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Required Inputs\n- Employee's total salary amount ; Number of actual working days in the month ; Leave policy type ; Public holidays falling in the calculation month | details: Sum of basic salary plus allowances used as the numerator in daily pay calculation. ; Total working days after deducting public holidays, or calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if calendar-based policy is used. Example: 22 working days minus 2 public holidays equals 20 actual working days. ; Either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as defined by organizational policy. ; Dates of public holidays that must be subtracted from working days to determine actual working days for calculation. | [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base selection ; Salary component selection | details: User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (total days in the month), working days (business days excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (user-defined number of days per month). ; User must choose which salary components to factor into calculations: basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. | [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Calculation basis selection | details: Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days to determine how salary proration is calculated. | [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Expected Outputs\n- Calculated daily pay rate ; Automatic pay deduction | details: The result of dividing total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days, expressed as a monetary value per day. ; A system-generated deduction associated with the approved unpaid leave request, reflected on the payroll table. | [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculated daily wage rates | details: System generates daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations based on the selected calculation base and salary components. | [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Updated salary calculations | details: System recalculates all active (unpaid) payroll amounts based on the newly selected calculation basis, proportionally adjusting employee compensation according to the selected method. | [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Procedures\n- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave** | when_to_use: When an unpaid leave request has been approved and a salary deduction must be calculated and applied to the employee's payroll. | steps: Receive and approve the unpaid leave request → Identify the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) → Determine the base number of days (e.g., 22 working days or 30 calendar days) → Identify all public holidays falling in the month of calculation → Subtract public holidays from the base number of days to arrive at actual working days → Retrieve the employee's total salary amount (basic + allowance) → Divide total salary by actual working days to calculate daily pay rate → Automatically generate pay deduction based on the number of unpaid leave days → Reflect the deduction on the payroll table | [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** | when_to_use: When setting up or modifying daily wage calculation methodology for payroll processing. | steps: Navigate to Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation → Select calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days → Choose salary components to include in calculation (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only) → Apply configuration; system will use these settings for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions | [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- **Update Salary Proration Configuration** | when_to_use: When the organization needs to change how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked, or when adjusting the calculation methodology for first salaries and end-of-service settlements. | steps: Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation → Select the desired calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days → Save the changes → If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions before saving new proration settings → Confirm that new proration settings have been applied to all active payroll amounts | [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. ; The number of days used in calculation is either calendar days (if following calendar days leave policy, e.g., 30 days) or working days (if following working days leave policy, e.g., 22 working days). ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the daily pay calculation. ; Pay deduction is automatically created and reflected on the payroll table upon approval of the unpaid leave request; manual intervention is not required. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 for January, 28 for February); working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays configured in the company's public holiday calendar; custom days allows user-defined daily calculation base. ; Most UAE and KSA companies use custom days set to 30 to align with local labor law requirements that define a month as 30 days. ; Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select and modify the calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration settings affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving. When the payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new salary proration changes. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from working days. For example, if 2 public holidays (National Day on 2nd and 3rd December) fall in a month with a 22 working-day policy, the actual working days become 20, not 22, resulting in a different daily pay calculation. ; The leave policy type (calendar days vs. working days) significantly impacts the daily pay calculation. Using the wrong policy type will result in incorrect deductions. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation results vary based on month length when using calendar days; February will produce different daily rates than months with 31 days, which may impact salary proration and leave encashment amounts. ; Different calculation methods (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) can produce significantly different final wage calculations; selection must align with company policy and regional labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions submitted for employees, Super admin must manually reject these transactions before saving new salary proration configuration changes to avoid conflicts. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator depends on the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and trigger automatic deduction creation. ; The daily wage calculator integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The daily wage calculator requires employee record system data to retrieve salary information (basic + allowance). [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three payroll functions: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations; changes to calculation base or salary components affect all three areas. ; Working days calculation base depends on the company's public holiday calendar configuration; public holidays must be accurately set up for correct daily wage calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly affects the payroll table's active (unpaid) transaction amounts. Changes to proration settings cascade to all open payroll transactions. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Glossary Terms\n- Daily pay ; Actual working days ; Unpaid leave ; Leave policy: The monetary amount calculated by dividing an employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, used to determine the deduction amount for unpaid leave. ; The number of working days in a month after deducting public holidays, used as the denominator in the daily pay calculation formula. ; Leave taken by an employee for which no pay is provided; the daily wage calculator computes the salary deduction associated with unpaid leave. ; The organizational rule defining whether leave is calculated based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days).
