### 📸 Screenshots Captured: 12

All screenshots show feature-relevant content with no cut-offs:

- End of service eligibility modals (screenshots 08-09)
- Leave policy configuration evidence (screenshots 01-05)

### 🎯 Key Validation Findings

1. **Override Mechanism Confirmed**: Leave policies show disabled fields when global daily wage calculation is configured, with clear messaging "Configured in daily wage calculation setting"

2. **Daily Wage Calculation Options**: Three calculation bases are available:
   - Salary proration: Basic salary + allowances / 30.45 days
   - EOS leave encashment: Basic salary + allowances / 22 days
   - Unpaid leave deduction: Basic salary + allowances / 30 days

3. **End of Service Integration**: Properly configured with override alerts and disabled configuration fields

4. **UI Consistency**: All navigation paths are accessible, fields show appropriate states, and override indicators are clearly visible

### ✅ Final Status: **VALIDATION PASSED**
