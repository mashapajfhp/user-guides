    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The system accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the total working days, and supports both calendar day and working day leave policies. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the calculator automatically generates the corresponding pay deduction and reflects it on the payroll table."

Provides an example showing how 2 public holidays reduce 22 working days to 20 actual working days for calculation purposes. Details that automatic pay deductions are created and reflected on the payroll table upon unpaid leave approval."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The system accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the total working days, and supports both calendar day and working day leave policies. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the calculator automatically generates the corresponding pay deduction and reflects it on the payroll table.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and automatically deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days, accounting for public holidays [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts, replacing previous limited calculation options.

The number of days used in calculation depends on the leave policy: either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 working days) ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the daily pay calculation ; Only approved unpaid leave requests trigger automatic pay deduction creation [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation uses actual month length: January has 31 days, February has 28 days (or 29 in leap years), and other months vary accordingly. ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar; only business days are counted. ; Custom days calculation allows payroll managers to set a fixed number of days per month according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies set custom days to 30 to comply with local labor law. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration settings affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon save. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new salary proration changes. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- When public holidays coincide with the month being calculated, they must be subtracted from the working days count. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a month with 22 working days, daily pay is calculated using 20 days instead of 22 ; The leave policy type (calendar days vs. working days) significantly impacts the daily pay calculation and must be correctly identified before calculation [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Monthly day count variations affect daily wage calculations: months with different numbers of days (28, 30, or 31) will produce different daily rates when using calendar days calculation base. ; Selection of different calculation bases (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) and different salary components can significantly impact final wage calculations for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are already submitted for employees, Super admin cannot simply save new proration settings; must first reject existing prorated salary transactions, then save the new proration configuration to avoid transaction conflicts. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- Integrates with leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests ; Integrates with payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table ; Depends on employee records system to retrieve salary information (basic salary and allowances) ; Depends on leave policy configuration to determine whether calendar days or working days are used [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three payroll processes: salary proration calculations, leave encashment calculations, and unpaid leave deduction calculations. ; Depends on company public holiday calendar configuration to accurately determine working days when working days calculation base is selected. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly impacts active payroll table transactions, employee first salary calculations, and end-of-service settlement amounts.
