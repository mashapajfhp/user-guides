  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-25  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The system accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the total working days, and supports both calendar day and working day leave policies. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the calculator automatically generates the corresponding pay deduction and reflects it on the payroll table.

## Knowledge Extract

### Job to be done

- Calculate and automatically deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days, accounting for public holidays
- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts, replacing previous limited calculation options.
- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement by selecting appropriate calculation bases (custom days, calendar days, or working days).

### Primary personas

- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave and salary calculations
- Superadmin, Payroll table managers, and transaction processors who configure and manage daily wage calculation settings.
- Super admin

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Payroll system → Unpaid leave requests → Approval workflow → Automatic pay deduction generation — _Users navigate to the payroll table to view and manage approved unpaid leave requests and their corresponding automatic pay deductions_
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point to configure daily wage calculator settings and select calculation bases and salary components. | Primary navigation route to access salary proration configuration interface where calculation bases are selected and saved._

### Prerequisites

- An unpaid leave request must be approved before daily pay calculation and deduction occurs ; The employee's leave policy must be defined as either calendar days or working days ; Public holidays for the month must be identified and recorded in the system
- User role must be Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor to access and configure Daily Wage Calculator settings. ; Company public holiday calendar must be configured to accurately exclude public holidays when using working days calculation base.
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings.

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount ; Number of working days or calendar days in the month ; Public holidays occurring in the month — _Calculated as Basic Salary + Allowance; used as numerator in daily pay formula ; Determined by the employee's leave policy; either working days (e.g., 22 days) or calendar days (e.g., 30 days) ; Used to calculate actual working days by subtracting from the total working days count_
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components selection — _User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (total days in month), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined number of days, typically 30 for UAE and KSA compliance). ; User must choose which salary components to include in calculations: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only._
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days to determine how salary proration is calculated._

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table ; Calculated daily pay rate — _Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically creates and displays the corresponding pay deduction in the payroll table ; The daily wage amount derived from dividing total salary by actual working days, used for deducting unpaid leave days from employee salary_
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System generates daily wage calculations that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction processes based on selected calculation base and salary components._
- Updated salary calculations — _System recalculates all active unpaid payroll amounts using the newly configured proration method, affecting employee first salaries and end-of-service settlements._

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave** — _When an unpaid leave request has been approved and needs to be reflected as a salary deduction_
  - Receive and approve unpaid leave request
  - Determine the employee's leave policy type (calendar days or working days)
  - Identify the total number of days in the policy for the month (e.g., 22 working days or 30 calendar days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling in the month
  - Subtract public holidays from the total working days to calculate actual working days
  - Calculate daily pay using formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Actual Working Days
  - System automatically generates and reflects the pay deduction on the payroll table
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up payroll system or updating daily wage calculation methodology to align with company policies or labor law requirements._
  - Navigate to Settings menu
  - Select Payroll section
  - Click on Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
  - Choose salary components to include (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only)
  - Apply configuration to impact salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations
- **Update Salary Proration** — _When organization needs to change how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked, or when adjusting calculation methodology for payroll accuracy._
  - Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation
  - Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days)
  - Save changes
  - If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions before saving new proration settings
  - Confirm new proration settings are applied to all active unpaid payroll amounts

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay formula is: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month ; The number of days used in calculation depends on the leave policy: either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 working days) ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the daily pay calculation ; Only approved unpaid leave requests trigger automatic pay deduction creation
- Calendar days calculation uses actual month length: January has 31 days, February has 28 days (or 29 in leap years), and other months vary accordingly. ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar; only business days are counted. ; Custom days calculation allows payroll managers to set a fixed number of days per month according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies set custom days to 30 to comply with local labor law.
- Changes to salary proration settings affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon save. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new salary proration changes.

### Edge cases and warnings

- When public holidays coincide with the month being calculated, they must be subtracted from the working days count. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a month with 22 working days, daily pay is calculated using 20 days instead of 22 ; The leave policy type (calendar days vs. working days) significantly impacts the daily pay calculation and must be correctly identified before calculation
- Monthly day count variations affect daily wage calculations: months with different numbers of days (28, 30, or 31) will produce different daily rates when using calendar days calculation base. ; Selection of different calculation bases (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) and different salary components can significantly impact final wage calculations for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction.
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are already submitted for employees, Super admin cannot simply save new proration settings; must first reject existing prorated salary transactions, then save the new proration configuration to avoid transaction conflicts.

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Integrates with leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests ; Integrates with payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table ; Depends on employee records system to retrieve salary information (basic salary and allowances) ; Depends on leave policy configuration to determine whether calendar days or working days are used
- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three payroll processes: salary proration calculations, leave encashment calculations, and unpaid leave deduction calculations. ; Depends on company public holiday calendar configuration to accurately determine working days when working days calculation base is selected.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly impacts active payroll table transactions, employee first salary calculations, and end-of-service settlement amounts.
