  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculator accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count, and supports both calendar day and working day leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table.

- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee before daily pay deduction can be calculated and applied
- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to accurately exclude weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation base.
- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator.
- Access to Leave Settings and ability to add or modify leave policies
- Super admin role and access to payroll settings; existing payroll system with employee salary data

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days or calendar days in the month based on leave policy, and approved unpaid leave days
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and choice of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request that is reflected on the payroll table, and the calculated daily pay rate used for the deduction
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and determines which salary components and calculation methods apply to leave encashments.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation that applies daily rates to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay rate by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service encashment eligibility.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days; the leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used; public holidays falling in the month are deducted from the working days count to determine actual working days
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month: 28-31), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select the calculation base.
- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Leave encashment configuration affects end-of-service calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be identified and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay; for example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days instead of 22
- Calculation varies by month length when using calendar days (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), and different calculation bases produce different daily wage rates that impact final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts.
- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when configuring leave encashment settings.
- Multiple options are available for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, requiring careful selection based on payroll policy requirements
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and integrates with leave management and employee record systems to access leave requests and employee salary information
- The Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It interacts with the company's public holiday calendar and payroll settings.
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service calculations, and Leave Management system to customize leave encashment policies.
- Interacts with the payroll system to apply daily deductions to monthly employee pay; related to leave encashment configuration and leave policy management
- Interacts with Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions; impacts first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations
