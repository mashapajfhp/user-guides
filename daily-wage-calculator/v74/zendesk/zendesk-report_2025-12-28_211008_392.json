    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculator accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count, and supports both calendar day and working day leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculator accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count, and supports both calendar day and working day leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control and alignment to company policies and labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Allow super admins to configure and customize leave encashment policies for end-of-service calculations by selecting salary components and calculation methods.

Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days; the leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used; public holidays falling in the month are deducted from the working days count to determine actual working days [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month: 28-31), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select the calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Leave encashment configuration affects end-of-service calculations. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be identified and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay; for example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days instead of 22 [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation varies by month length when using calendar days (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), and different calculation bases produce different daily wage rates that impact final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when configuring leave encashment settings.
