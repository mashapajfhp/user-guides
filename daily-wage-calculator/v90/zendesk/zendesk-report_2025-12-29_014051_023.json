    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, with support for different calculation bases and salary component selections.

If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible basis set by company policy). Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to align with labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component options limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances; calculation method options limited to Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days; only super admins can define and modify these settings [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if two days are public holidays and the leave policy is based on 22 working days, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days (22 minus 2), not the full 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation results vary depending on month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), and different calculation methods can significantly impact final wage calculations for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when configuring leave encashment, allowing visibility of policy impact before finalizing changes [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and must be selected appropriately based on payroll requirements; day calculation type selection (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days) affects how daily rates are computed [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and integrates with leave management and employee record systems to process approved unpaid leave requests.
