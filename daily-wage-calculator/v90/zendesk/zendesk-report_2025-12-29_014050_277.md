  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table.

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee before daily pay deduction is calculated and reflected on the payroll table.
- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to properly exclude public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
- Super admin role with access to payroll settings; existing leave type policies that may be affected by encashment configuration
- Access to Leave Settings configuration as a Super Admin; ability to add a new leave policy
- Super admin role is required to access and modify daily wage calculation settings.

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days in the month, leave policy type (calendar days or working days), and approved unpaid leave days.
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Salary components selection (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days.

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, reflected on the payroll table, and calculated daily pay rate used to determine the salary reduction amount.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and visibility of which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation method that applies daily deductions to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method, affecting first salary and end-of-service settlement amounts.

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay rate by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure; 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances); 3. Choose calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days); 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations; 5. Review which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation.
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible basis set by company policy). Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to align with labor law requirements.
- Salary component options limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances; calculation method options limited to Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days; only super admins can define and modify these settings
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if two days are public holidays and the leave policy is based on 22 working days, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days (22 minus 2), not the full 22 days.
- Calculation results vary depending on month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), and different calculation methods can significantly impact final wage calculations for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when configuring leave encashment, allowing visibility of policy impact before finalizing changes
- Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and must be selected appropriately based on payroll requirements; day calculation type selection (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days) affects how daily rates are computed
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings.

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and integrates with leave management and employee record systems to process approved unpaid leave requests.
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, the company's public holiday calendar, and leave management systems to calculate accurate daily wage rates for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction.
- Interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service calculations, and Leave Management system to customize leave encashment policies and affect how leave is valued during end-of-service
- Interacts with the payroll system to apply calculated daily deductions to monthly employee pay; related to Leave Encashment feature which uses similar daily rate calculation logic
- The daily wage calculator interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions, including first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations.
