  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to determine the actual working days used in the formula. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation
- Access the Daily Wage Calculator by navigating to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure.
- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection
- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation to access salary proration configuration

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee before daily pay deduction is calculated and reflected on payroll.
- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to exclude weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation base
- Super admin role with access to payroll settings is required to configure leave encashment policies.
- Access to Leave Settings configuration as a Super Admin; ability to add a new leave policy
- Super admin role required to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount (basic salary plus allowances), number of working days or calendar days in the month based on the leave policy, and the number of public holidays falling in the month.
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and salary components to include (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only)
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment configuration.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request that is reflected on the payroll table, and the calculated daily pay rate used for the deduction.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and visibility of which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation settings that apply daily rates to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method; changes apply to all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days to arrive at actual working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary amount by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select a calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to factor into the calculations
- 1. Access Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select applicable salary components for leave encashment (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of Actual Working Days. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to calculate actual working days used in the formula.
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to align with labor law); the selected calculation base directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts
- Salary component selection is limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Super admins can configure specific leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options
- Changes to salary proration affect all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new salary proration settings

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation must be based on 20 days, not 22 days.
- Calendar days calculation varies by month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations; different calculation methods can produce significantly different wage amounts
- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when configuring leave encashment settings.
- Multiple options are available for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, requiring careful selection based on organizational payroll policy
- When payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and connects with leave management systems to receive approved unpaid leave requests and employee record systems to access salary information.

- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service calculations, and Leave Management system to customize leave encashment policies.
- Interacts with the payroll system by calculating daily deductions that are applied to monthly employee pay; related to leave encashment configuration
- Interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions; impacts employee first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations
