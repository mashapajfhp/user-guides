    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to determine the actual working days used in the formula. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays, which are subtracted from the total working days to determine the actual working days used in the formula. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Allow super admins to configure and customize leave encashment policies for end-of-service calculations by selecting salary components and calculation methods.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and salary components to include (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only) [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment configuration.

Access Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select applicable salary components for leave encashment (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3.

[Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days) [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of Actual Working Days. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to calculate actual working days used in the formula. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to align with labor law); the selected calculation base directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component selection is limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Super admins can configure specific leave types for end-of-service calculations. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation must be based on 20 days, not 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation varies by month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations; different calculation methods can produce significantly different wage amounts [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when configuring leave encashment settings.
