# Claims to Validate

> **Note:** Jira claims provide test hypotheses based on ticket evidence. Navigation paths come from Zendesk documentation matching.

## System Behavior

### Leap Year Day Inclusion

**Test Hypothesis:** How might we verify that the system correctly handles February 29th in service duration calculations?

**Evidence Summary:** System must recognize and include 366 days when calculating service periods in leap years

**Meta:** id=JIRA_001 | origin=jira | playwright=NO | blocker=NEEDS_ZENDESK_NAVIGATION

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-4179, TSSD-1625

**UI Indicators:**
- Leap year detection
- Service duration calculation

**Selector Hints:**
- text:Leap Year
- text:Service Duration
- Leap year detection
- Service duration calculation

**Preconditions:**
- Prepare test data to reproduce the scenario described by the ticket(s)

**Steps:**
- Log in as a user who can access the feature (admin if required)
- Navigate to the feature area relevant to this claim

**Expected:**
- System recognizes February 29th in leap years
- Total service days include 366 days for 2024
- Result is observable (in UI or logs) and consistent with the claim statement

## System Boundary

### Global Daily Rate Configuration

**Test Hypothesis:** How might we verify that global daily rate settings override policy-level configurations?

**Evidence Summary:** System has a global configuration that takes precedence over individual policy settings

**Meta:** id=JIRA_002 | origin=jira | playwright=NO | blocker=NEEDS_ZENDESK_NAVIGATION

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-1753

**UI Indicators:**
- Global settings
- Policy override

**Selector Hints:**

- text:Daily Rate
- Global settings
- Policy override

**Preconditions:**
- Prepare test data to reproduce the scenario described by the ticket(s)

**Steps:**
- Log in as a user who can access the feature (admin if required)
- Navigate to the feature area relevant to this claim
- Open the relevant Settings / Configuration section for the feature
- Locate the UI element referenced in the claim (label/field/value/tooltip/etc.)

**Expected:**
- Global daily rate settings are visible
- Global settings override policy-level calculations
- UI state matches the claim expectation and does not show contradictory information
