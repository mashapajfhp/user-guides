  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculator accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working day count and supports both calendar day and working day leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the employee's leave policy and the specific month's working days.

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation.
- Access the Daily Wage Calculator by navigating to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure.
- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection
- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation to access salary proration configuration

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee; the employee's salary information (basic and allowance components) must be configured in the system.
- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to accurately exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator.
- Access to Leave Settings and Leave Policies configuration as a Super Admin
- Super admin role and access to payroll settings; payroll system must be configured

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount (basic plus allowance), number of working days in the month, number of public holidays in the month, and the applicable leave policy type (calendar days or working days).
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment configuration.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, reflected on the payroll table; calculated daily pay rate used to determine the total deduction amount.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and determines which salary components and calculation methods apply to leave encashment.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation settings that apply daily deductions to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) payroll amounts

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate the total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days to arrive at actual working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary amount by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select applicable salary components for leave encashment (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types eligible for encashment in end-of-service calculations.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and resave the proration settings to apply changes.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of Actual Working Days. The leave policy determines whether calculation is based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to determine actual working days used in the calculation.
- Calculation base options are calendar days (total days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible configuration per company policy). Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with labor law requirements.
- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method must be one of three options: calendar days, working days, or custom days. Leave encashment configuration affects end-of-service calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected during policy configuration
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working policy, the calculation uses 20 days instead of 22 days.
- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., January has 31 days, February has 28 days), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation bases produce different daily wage rates and impact final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts.
- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new leave encashment configuration, allowing them to understand the impact of their changes.
- Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days), requiring careful selection based on organizational policy
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions; integrates with leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and with employee record systems to access salary information.
- The Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It depends on the company's public holiday calendar configuration and integrates with payroll processing systems.
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with payroll settings, end-of-service calculations, and leave management systems to customize leave encashment policies that affect final settlement calculations.
- Interacts with the payroll system to apply daily unpaid leave deductions to monthly employee pay; similar to leave encashment functionality
- Interacts with Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions; impacts first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations
