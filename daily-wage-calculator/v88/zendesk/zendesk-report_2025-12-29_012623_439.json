    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculator accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working day count and supports both calendar day and working day leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the employee's leave policy and the specific month's working days."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculator accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working day count and supports both calendar day and working day leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the employee's leave policy and the specific month's working days.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts based on different calculation bases and salary components. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Allow super admins to configure and customize leave encashment policies for end-of-service calculations, including selection of salary components and calculation methods. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Calculate and manage unpaid leave deductions on a daily basis to be set off against the employee's monthly pay [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Primary Personas\n- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave and salary calculations. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Superadmin, Payroll table managers, and transaction processors who configure and manage daily wage calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins responsible for payroll and HR settings configuration. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Super Admins who configure leave policies and payroll settings [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Super admin users who manage payroll configuration and salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Navigation Paths\n- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Access the Daily Wage Calculator by navigating to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation to access salary proration configuration [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Prerequisites\n- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee; the employee's salary information (basic and allowance components) must be configured in the system. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to accurately exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Access to Leave Settings and Leave Policies configuration as a Super Admin [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Super admin role and access to payroll settings; payroll system must be configured [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Required Inputs\n- Employee's total salary amount (basic plus allowance), number of working days in the month, number of public holidays in the month, and the applicable leave policy type (calendar days or working days). [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only). [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment configuration.

If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and resave the proration settings to apply changes. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of Actual Working Days. The leave policy determines whether calculation is based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to determine actual working days used in the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are calendar days (total days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible configuration per company policy). Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method must be one of three options: calendar days, working days, or custom days. Leave encashment configuration affects end-of-service calculations. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected during policy configuration [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working policy, the calculation uses 20 days instead of 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., January has 31 days, February has 28 days), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation bases produce different daily wage rates and impact final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new leave encashment configuration, allowing them to understand the impact of their changes. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days), requiring careful selection based on organizational policy [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- Interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions; integrates with leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and with employee record systems to access salary information.

It depends on the company's public holiday calendar configuration and integrates with payroll processing systems. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with payroll settings, end-of-service calculations, and leave management systems to customize leave encashment policies that affect final settlement calculations.
