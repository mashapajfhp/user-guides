  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculator accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.

- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee before daily pay deduction can be calculated and applied.
- Company's public holiday calendar must be configured to accurately exclude weekends and public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
- Super admin role with access to payroll settings is required to configure leave encashment policies.
- Access to Leave Settings and ability to add a new leave policy
- Super admin role required to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days or calendar days in the month based on the leave policy, and the number of approved unpaid leave days.
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to include (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), choice of calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and configuration of eligible leave types for encashment.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request that is reflected on the payroll table, and the calculated daily pay rate used for the deduction.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and determines which salary components and leave types are included in encashment calculations.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation settings that apply daily deductions to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay rate by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to factor into calculations.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used as the basis. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation.
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Different calculation bases produce different daily wage rates.
- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method selection is limited to three options: calendar days, working days, or custom days. Super admins can configure which eligible paid leave types will be included in encashment calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must reject existing transactions before saving new proration settings

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation must use 20 days instead of 22 days.
- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations. Working days calculation depends on accurate public holiday calendar configuration. Custom days setting must align with company policies and applicable labor law requirements.
- Super admins should be aware that configuring leave encashment policies will overwrite existing eligible paid leave-type policies; the system provides visibility into which policies will be affected by the new configuration.
- Multiple options are available for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, requiring careful selection based on organizational policy
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject those transactions before saving changes to salary proration settings

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and integrates with leave management and employee record systems to retrieve leave policy information and employee salary data.
- The Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It interacts with the company's public holiday calendar configuration and payroll settings.
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with payroll settings, end-of-service calculations, and leave management systems to customize leave encashment policies that affect final settlement calculations.
- Interacts with the payroll system to apply calculated daily deductions to monthly employee pay; related to leave encashment configuration
- Interacts with the Payroll system and payroll table; affects active payroll transactions and end-of-service settlement calculations
