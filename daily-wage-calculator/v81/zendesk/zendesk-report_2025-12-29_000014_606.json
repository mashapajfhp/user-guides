    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculator accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculator accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control over calculation methodology. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Allow super admins to configure and customize leave encashment policies for end-of-service calculations, including selection of applicable salary components and calculation methods.

If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used as the basis. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Different calculation bases produce different daily wage rates. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances.
