    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the per-day pay rate. The calculator accounts for leave policy variations (calendar days vs. working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working day counts to ensure accurate salary reductions. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table."

The article provides a concrete example showing how 2 public holidays reduce the calculation basis from 22 working days to 20 days."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the per-day pay rate. The calculator accounts for leave policy variations (calendar days vs. working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working day counts to ensure accurate salary reductions. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days, accounting for public holidays and leave policy type [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration amounts, leave encashment values, and unpaid leave deductions with greater control over calculation methodology. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement through selection of calculation bases (custom days, calendar days, or working days).

Leave policy can follow either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) methodology ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at actual working days ; Pay deduction is automatically created only upon approval of unpaid leave request [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation uses actual number of days in each month (31 for January, 28 for February, etc.); working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in company's public holiday calendar; custom days allows fixed day count per month regardless of actual calendar. ; Most companies in UAE and KSA use 30 custom days to comply with labor law requirements that define a month as 30 days. ; Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select the calculation base for daily wage. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration settings will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new salary proration changes [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from working days; failure to account for holidays results in incorrect daily pay calculation and overstated deductions ; When leave policy is based on working days (e.g., 22 days), public holidays are deducted from this baseline; for example, 2 public holidays reduce the calculation basis from 22 to 20 days [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation will vary month-to-month based on actual calendar (January has 31 days, February has 28 days), which directly impacts daily wage rate calculations and resulting salary proration and leave encashment amounts. ; Different calculation bases (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) will produce different daily wage rates and therefore different final amounts for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions after updating salary proration settings to ensure consistency [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- Interacts with leave management system to receive and process unpaid leave requests ; Integrates with payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on payroll table ; Depends on employee record system to access salary information (Basic + Allowance) ; Depends on calendar system to identify and account for public holidays in the calculation month [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three payroll functions: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction; configuration changes affect all three areas simultaneously. ; Calculation accuracy depends on company's public holiday calendar configuration when using working days calculation base.
