  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-25  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the per-day pay rate. The calculator accounts for leave policy variations (calendar days vs. working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working day counts to ensure accurate salary reductions. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table.

## Knowledge Extract

### Job to be done

- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days, accounting for public holidays and leave policy type
- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration amounts, leave encashment values, and unpaid leave deductions with greater control over calculation methodology.
- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement through selection of calculation bases (custom days, calendar days, or working days).

### Primary personas

- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave and salary calculations
- Superadmin, Payroll table managers, and transaction processors who configure and manage daily wage calculations.
- Super admin

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Generation → Payroll Table Reflection — _User approves unpaid leave request which triggers automatic daily pay calculation and deduction creation_
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point to the Daily Wage Calculator feature. | Primary navigation to access salary proration configuration in the Daily Wage Calculator_

### Prerequisites

- Unpaid leave request must be approved before daily pay deduction is automatically created ; Leave policy must be configured as either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days)
- Company must have a configured public holiday calendar to accurately exclude weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation base.
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary (Basic + Allowance) ; Number of actual working days in the month ; Public holidays falling within the calculation month ; Leave policy type (calendar days or working days) — _Sum of basic salary and all applicable allowances used as numerator in daily pay calculation ; Total working days based on leave policy (calendar or working days), adjusted for public holidays ; Public holiday dates that must be deducted from working days to calculate actual working days ; Determines whether calculation uses calendar days (30) or working days (22) as the baseline_
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components to include — _User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (total days in month), working days (business days excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (user-defined number of days, typically 30 in UAE and KSA). ; User must choose which salary components to factor into calculations: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only._
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days_

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table ; Calculated daily pay rate — _Once unpaid leave is approved, a pay deduction is automatically created and displayed in payroll records ; Daily pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month_
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System generates daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations based on selected calculation base and salary components._
- Updated salary calculations — _Proportionally adjusted employee compensation based on selected calculation method (custom days, calendar days, or working days) that affects all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** — _When an unpaid leave request has been approved and daily pay deduction needs to be calculated and applied to payroll_
  - Receive and approve unpaid leave request
  - Identify the leave policy type (calendar days or working days)
  - Determine the baseline number of days (e.g., 30 calendar days or 22 working days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling within the month
  - Subtract public holidays from baseline days to calculate actual working days
  - Obtain employee's total salary (Basic + Allowance)
  - Apply formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount / Actual Working Days
  - Automatic pay deduction is created and reflected on payroll table
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up payroll calculation methodology or when organizational policies or labor law requirements change._
  - Navigate to Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select calculation base from three options: calendar days, working days, or custom days
  - Choose salary components to include in calculation (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only)
  - Apply configuration; system will use these settings for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations
- **Update Salary Proration** — _When adjusting how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked, or when changing the calculation basis for salary proration_
  - Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation
  - Select the required calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days
  - Save changes
  - If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions before saving the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (Basic + Allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month ; Leave policy can follow either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) methodology ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at actual working days ; Pay deduction is automatically created only upon approval of unpaid leave request
- Calendar days calculation uses actual number of days in each month (31 for January, 28 for February, etc.); working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in company's public holiday calendar; custom days allows fixed day count per month regardless of actual calendar. ; Most companies in UAE and KSA use 30 custom days to comply with labor law requirements that define a month as 30 days. ; Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select the calculation base for daily wage.
- Changes to salary proration settings will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new salary proration changes

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from working days; failure to account for holidays results in incorrect daily pay calculation and overstated deductions ; When leave policy is based on working days (e.g., 22 days), public holidays are deducted from this baseline; for example, 2 public holidays reduce the calculation basis from 22 to 20 days
- Calendar days calculation will vary month-to-month based on actual calendar (January has 31 days, February has 28 days), which directly impacts daily wage rate calculations and resulting salary proration and leave encashment amounts. ; Different calculation bases (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) will produce different daily wage rates and therefore different final amounts for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- When payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions after updating salary proration settings to ensure consistency

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Interacts with leave management system to receive and process unpaid leave requests ; Integrates with payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on payroll table ; Depends on employee record system to access salary information (Basic + Allowance) ; Depends on calendar system to identify and account for public holidays in the calculation month
- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three payroll functions: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction; configuration changes affect all three areas simultaneously. ; Calculation accuracy depends on company's public holiday calendar configuration when using working days calculation base.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions; changes to proration settings impact first salary calculations and end-of-service settlements
