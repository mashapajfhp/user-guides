## Known Issue

### Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation

**Statement:** System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were calculated based on outdated salary configurations instead of the most recent salary setup, resulting in incorrect payroll deductions.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_001 | playwright=NO | test_data=YES | limitation_type=calculation_bug | blocker=ASYNC_RECALC_OR_TXN_LIFECYCLE

### Global Daily Rate Configuration Overrides Policy Settings

**Statement:** The system applies a global daily rate configuration that supersedes individual leave policy settings for unpaid leave calculations. This results in deductions being calculated using a system-wide method instead of policy-specific calculations.

### Persistent Payroll Deductions After Leave Request Deletion

**Statement:** When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Deleting the leave request does not remove associated payroll deductions.

### End of Service Gratuity Leap Year Miscalculation

### Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy in Leap Year

**Statement:** The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently handle leap year days (February 29th), causing minor discrepancies in total service days and resulting gratuity amount. The difference was observed between manual calculation (913 days) and system calculation (912 days), leading to a slight variation in gratuity amount from AED 14,708.05 to AED 14,691.95.

### Leave Salary Proration Calculation Discrepancy

**Statement:** The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using independent daily wage configurations with different divisors (30 vs 30.42 days), causing calculation mismatches. This means the leave salary calculation does not match the client's expected proration formula of (Basic salary + allowances / 30.42 days).

### End of Service Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Error

**Statement:** End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals.

### Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Formula

**Statement:** The daily wage calculator in payroll settings intentionally overrides the formula configured in leave policy for unpaid leave. The leave policy formula appears greyed out, indicating it is not active. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied for daily wage calculations.

### Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees

**Statement:** The system fails to correctly prorate salaries when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing date. When an employee is offboarded (e.g., on Nov 28th) and payroll is processed earlier (e.g., on Nov 27th), the system displays the full monthly salary instead of prorating it.
