    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides an employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the actual number of working or calendar days in the month to determine the per-day pay rate. Public holidays are explicitly deducted from working day counts to ensure accurate calculations. The calculated daily pay is then used to generate automatic pay deductions reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. This feature ensures consistent and compliant salary deductions across the organization's leave management process."

It explains that daily pay is derived by dividing an employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month. The article specifies that organizations can use either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) based on their leave policy. Crucially, public holidays falling within the month must be deducted from the working day count to calculate actual working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, an automatic pay deduction associated with that request is created and reflected on the payroll table using the calculated daily pay rate."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides an employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the actual number of working or calendar days in the month to determine the per-day pay rate. Public holidays are explicitly deducted from working day counts to ensure accurate calculations. The calculated daily pay is then used to generate automatic pay deductions reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. This feature ensures consistent and compliant salary deductions across the organization's leave management process.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control than previously available fixed calculation options. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement by selecting appropriate calculation bases (custom days, calendar days, or working days). [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Primary Personas\n- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave requests and salary calculations. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Superadmin, Payroll table managers, and transaction processors who configure and manage daily wage calculation settings.

[Articles: 14243704039185]\n- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Required Inputs\n- Employee's total salary (Basic + Allowance) ; Number of actual working days in the month ; Public holiday dates falling within the month | details: The complete salary amount including base salary and all applicable allowances is required for the daily pay calculation. ; The count of working days (e.g., 22 days) or calendar days (e.g., 30 days) depending on the organization's leave policy, with public holidays deducted from the total. ; Specific dates designated as public holidays must be identified and subtracted from the working day count to calculate actual working days. | [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base selection ; Salary components to include | details: User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (total days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (user-defined, commonly set to 30 for UAE/KSA compliance). ; User must choose which salary elements to factor into calculations: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. | [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Calculation basis selection | details: Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days to determine how salary proration is calculated | [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Expected Outputs\n- Calculated daily pay rate ; Automatic pay deduction reflected on payroll table | details: The result of dividing total salary by actual working days, expressed as a per-day pay amount used for unpaid leave deductions. ; Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, a pay deduction associated with the specific request is automatically created and displayed on the payroll table. | [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculated daily wage rates | details: System generates daily wage calculations used for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction based on selected calculation base and salary components. | [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Updated salary calculations | details: Proportionally adjusted employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table | [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Procedures\n- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** | when_to_use: When an unpaid leave request has been approved and a salary deduction must be calculated and applied to the employee's payroll. | steps: Receive and approve the unpaid leave request → Identify the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) → Determine the total number of days in the leave policy (e.g., 22 working days or 30 calendar days) → Identify all public holidays falling within the calculation month → Subtract public holidays from the total day count to arrive at actual working days → Obtain the employee's total salary (Basic + Allowance) → Divide total salary by actual working days to calculate daily pay → Automatically generate and reflect the pay deduction on the payroll table | [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** | when_to_use: When setting up or modifying daily wage calculation methodology for payroll processing. | steps: Navigate to Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation → Select calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days → Choose salary components to include in calculation (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only) → System applies selected configuration to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations | [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- **Update Salary Proration** | when_to_use: When Super admin needs to change how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked, or to adjust calculation methodology for ongoing payroll | steps: Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation → Select the required calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days → Save the changes → If payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, reject the existing transactions before saving new proration settings → Confirm new proration settings are applied | [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay calculation formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. ; The leave policy can be based on either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 working days); the calculation method must align with the organization's leave policy. ; Public holidays falling within the month must be deducted from the working day count before calculating daily pay; they are not counted as working days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are limited to three types: calendar days (actual days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (user-defined per company policy). Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 in February). Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to align with regional labor law requirements. ; Salary component selection is limited to three options: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving changes to salary proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- When public holidays fall within the calculation month, they must be explicitly subtracted from the working day count. For example, if 2 public holidays occur in a 22-working-day month, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily wage calculations vary significantly based on month length when using calendar days method (e.g., January has 31 days while February has 28), which directly impacts final wage amounts for salary proration and leave encashment. Different calculation bases produce different results and must be selected carefully to ensure compliance with company policy and labor law. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then resave the changes for salary proration to take effect properly. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator interacts with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and with the payroll system to automatically generate and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with public holiday calendar configuration to exclude weekends and public holidays when working days calculation base is selected. Calculator output directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction modules within payroll system. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) interacts with the Payroll system and directly affects active payroll table transactions; salary proration impacts employee's first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Glossary Terms\n- Daily pay ; Actual working days ; Unpaid leave: The per-day salary amount calculated by dividing an employee's total salary (Basic + Allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, used to deduct unpaid leave days from an employee's salary. ; The number of working days in a month after deducting public holidays; used as the denominator in daily pay calculation. ; Leave taken by an employee for which no salary is paid; deductions are calculated using the daily pay rate.
