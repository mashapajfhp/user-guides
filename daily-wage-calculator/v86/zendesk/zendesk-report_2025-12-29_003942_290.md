  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system creates an automatic pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table.

- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation method that applies daily deductions to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request; approve leave request; determine leave policy type (calendar or working days); calculate total working days in the month; subtract public holidays from working days; calculate daily pay rate by dividing salary by actual working days; generate automatic payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations. 5. Review which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and resave the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days. The leave policy can use either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation.
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month, e.g., 31 for January, 28 for February), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select the calculation base.
- Salary component selection limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method selection limited to three options: Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Configuration applies to individual leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected when configuring the policy
- Changes to salary proration affect all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working policy, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days.
- Calculation results vary depending on the month length when using calendar days, and different calculation methods (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) can significantly impact final wage calculations. Companies must ensure their chosen method aligns with applicable labor laws.
- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new leave encashment configuration, allowing them to review potential impacts before finalizing settings
- Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days), requiring careful selection based on organizational policy
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject existing transactions and resave proration settings to apply changes
