    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system creates an automatic pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system creates an automatic pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, with options to select calculation bases and salary components. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Allow super admins to configure and customize leave encashment policies for end-of-service calculations by selecting salary components and calculation methods [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Calculate and manage unpaid leave deductions on a daily basis to be set off against the employee's monthly pay [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- To adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Primary Personas\n- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave and salary calculations. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Superadmin, Payroll table managers, and transaction processors who configure and manage daily wage calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins responsible for payroll and HR settings configuration [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Super Admins who configure leave policies and unpaid leave deduction settings [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Super admin users who manage payroll configuration and salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Navigation Paths\n- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation.

The leave policy can use either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month, e.g., 31 for January, 28 for February), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select the calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component selection limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances.

[Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected when configuring the policy [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working policy, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation results vary depending on the month length when using calendar days, and different calculation methods (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) can significantly impact final wage calculations. Companies must ensure their chosen method aligns with applicable labor laws. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the new leave encashment configuration, allowing them to review potential impacts before finalizing settings [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days), requiring careful selection based on organizational policy [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject existing transactions and resave proration settings to apply changes [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- Interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions; integrates with leave management system for unpaid leave request approval; connects with employee record systems to access salary information.
