    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature integrates with the leave management system to generate automatic pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the organization's leave policy and holiday calendar. The calculator supports both calendar-day and working-day leave policies."

It defines the daily pay formula as Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by the number of actual working days in the month. The article clarifies that the leave policy determines whether calculations are based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days), and that public holidays must be deducted from the working days total. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, an automatic pay deduction is created and reflected on the payroll table. The article includes a worked example showing how public holidays reduce the working days used in the calculation."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature integrates with the leave management system to generate automatic pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the organization's leave policy and holiday calendar. The calculator supports both calendar-day and working-day leave policies.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and automatically deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays.

The leave policy determines whether calculations are based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days total to arrive at the actual working days used in the daily pay calculation. ; An automatic pay deduction is created only upon approval of an unpaid leave request; the deduction is associated with the specific request. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation: The number of days varies by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February). ; Working days calculation: Only business days are counted; weekends and public holidays (configured in company's public holiday calendar) are excluded. ; Custom days calculation: Payroll table managers can set custom calculation bases according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with labor law. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration settings will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- When public holidays fall within the month, they must be explicitly subtracted from the working days count. For example, if 2 days are public holidays and the policy specifies 22 working days, the actual working days used for calculation is 20, not 22. ; The calculation method differs based on the leave policy in use: organizations using calendar days (e.g., 30 days) will have different daily pay amounts than those using working days (e.g., 22 days) for the same salary, even before public holiday adjustments. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Month length variation: February has fewer calendar days (28) than other months (30-31), which affects daily wage calculations if calendar days calculation base is used. ; Different calculation methods produce different final wage amounts; selection of calculation base and salary components directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction values. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings; failure to do so may result in inconsistent salary calculations [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator depends on the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and trigger automatic pay deduction creation. ; The feature integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The feature relies on employee record systems to retrieve salary information (Basic + Allowance) for each employee. ; The feature depends on a maintained public holiday calendar to accurately determine which days should be excluded from working day calculations. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. Configuration of the calculator directly affects how these payroll functions calculate amounts. ; Depends on company's public holiday calendar configuration when using working days calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and payroll table; changes to salary proration settings directly impact active payroll transactions and employee first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Glossary Terms\n- Daily Pay ; Actual Working Days ; Unpaid Leave ; Pay Deduction: The amount of salary deducted per day for unpaid leave, calculated as Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by the number of actual working days in the month. ; The number of working days in a month after deducting public holidays from the total working days specified in the leave policy. ; Leave taken by an employee for which no salary is paid; the daily wage calculator determines the salary deduction amount for each day of unpaid leave. ; An automatic reduction in an employee's salary created and associated with an approved unpaid leave request, calculated using the daily pay formula and reflected on the payroll table.
