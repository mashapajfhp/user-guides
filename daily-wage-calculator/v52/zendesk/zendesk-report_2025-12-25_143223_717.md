  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-25  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature integrates with the leave management system to generate automatic pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the organization's leave policy and holiday calendar. The calculator supports both calendar-day and working-day leave policies.

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Creation → Payroll Table Reflection — _The workflow begins when an unpaid leave request is received, moves through approval, triggers automatic daily pay calculation, and results in a deduction visible on the payroll table._
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point for the Daily Wage Calculator feature. | Primary navigation path to access salary proration configuration_

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist before daily pay deduction is calculated and created. ; The organization must have a defined leave policy specifying either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the basis for calculations. ; Public holiday calendar data must be available and current for the month in which daily pay is being calculated.
- User must have Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator. ; Company public holiday calendar must be configured if using working days calculation base.
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount ; Number of actual working days or calendar days in the month ; Public holidays falling in the month ; Approved unpaid leave request details — _Calculated as Basic Salary + Allowance; this is the numerator in the daily pay formula. ; Determined by the organization's leave policy; can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). ; Public holidays must be identified and counted to be deducted from the working days total to arrive at actual working days. ; The specific unpaid leave request that triggers the automatic pay deduction creation._
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components to include ; Custom days value (if applicable) — _User must select from calendar days, working days, or custom days as the basis for daily wage calculation. ; User must choose which salary components to factor into calculations: basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. ; If custom days calculation base is selected, user must specify the number of days (e.g., 30 days for UAE and KSA labor law compliance)._
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days_

### Outputs and results

- Calculated daily pay rate ; Automatic pay deduction ; Updated payroll table entry — _The result of dividing salary amount (Basic + Allowance) by the number of actual working days, expressed as a monetary value per day. ; A deduction associated with the specific unpaid leave request, automatically created upon approval and reflected on the payroll table. ; The payroll table is updated to show the automatic pay deduction for the employee in the relevant pay period._
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System generates daily wage rates used for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations based on selected parameters._
- Updated salary calculations — _Proportionally adjusted employee compensation based on the selected calculation method, affecting all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** — _When an unpaid leave request has been approved and a salary deduction needs to be calculated and applied to the employee's payroll._
  - Receive and review the unpaid leave request
  - Approve the unpaid leave request
  - Identify the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days)
  - Determine the total number of days in the policy (e.g., 30 calendar days or 22 working days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling in the month
  - Subtract public holidays from the total working days to calculate actual working days
  - Apply the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Actual Working Days
  - The system automatically creates a pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request
  - Verify the deduction is reflected on the payroll table
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up payroll calculations or modifying how daily wages are calculated for your organization._
  - Navigate to Settings
  - Select Payroll
  - Choose Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days
  - Choose salary components to include in calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only)
  - Apply configuration
- **Update Salary Proration** — _When configuring how employee salaries should be prorated based on days worked, or when changing calculation bases for first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations_
  - Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation
  - Select the required calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days
  - Save the changes
  - If payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, reject those transactions before the new proration settings take effect
  - Resave the proration settings to confirm

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing the total salary amount (Basic + Allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. ; The leave policy determines whether calculations are based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days total to arrive at the actual working days used in the daily pay calculation. ; An automatic pay deduction is created only upon approval of an unpaid leave request; the deduction is associated with the specific request.
- Calendar days calculation: The number of days varies by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February). ; Working days calculation: Only business days are counted; weekends and public holidays (configured in company's public holiday calendar) are excluded. ; Custom days calculation: Payroll table managers can set custom calculation bases according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with labor law.
- Changes to salary proration settings will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new salary proration settings

### Edge cases and warnings

- When public holidays fall within the month, they must be explicitly subtracted from the working days count. For example, if 2 days are public holidays and the policy specifies 22 working days, the actual working days used for calculation is 20, not 22. ; The calculation method differs based on the leave policy in use: organizations using calendar days (e.g., 30 days) will have different daily pay amounts than those using working days (e.g., 22 days) for the same salary, even before public holiday adjustments.
- Month length variation: February has fewer calendar days (28) than other months (30-31), which affects daily wage calculations if calendar days calculation base is used. ; Different calculation methods produce different final wage amounts; selection of calculation base and salary components directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction values.
- If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings; failure to do so may result in inconsistent salary calculations

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator depends on the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and trigger automatic pay deduction creation. ; The feature integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The feature relies on employee record systems to retrieve salary information (Basic + Allowance) for each employee. ; The feature depends on a maintained public holiday calendar to accurately determine which days should be excluded from working day calculations.
- Daily Wage Calculator impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. Configuration of the calculator directly affects how these payroll functions calculate amounts. ; Depends on company's public holiday calendar configuration when using working days calculation base.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and payroll table; changes to salary proration settings directly impact active payroll transactions and employee first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations
