  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-26  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system component that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the specific leave policy and calendar circumstances.

- To adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement

### Primary personas

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Access the daily wage calculator through the payroll system after approving an unpaid leave request; the system automatically generates pay deductions reflected on the payroll table.
- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation.
- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation to access the salary proration configuration interface

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee; the employee's salary information (basic and allowance amounts) must be configured in the system.
- Company's public holiday calendar must be configured to exclude weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation base.
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount (basic plus allowance), number of working days or calendar days in the month based on the leave policy, approved unpaid leave days, and public holidays falling within the month.
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and choice of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, calculated daily pay rate, and the deduction reflected on the payroll table.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method, affecting first salary and end-of-service settlement amounts

### Procedures

- Receive and approve unpaid leave request; determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days); identify public holidays in the month; calculate actual working days by subtracting public holidays from the total working days; divide total salary by actual working days to calculate daily pay; system automatically generates and reflects the pay deduction on the payroll table.
- Navigate to Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation, select a calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), choose salary components to include in the calculation, and apply the configuration.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of Actual Working Days. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used as the base. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation.
- Three calculation bases are available: calendar days (actual days in a month, e.g., 31 for January, 28 for February), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), and custom days (flexible basis set by payroll managers, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to align with labor law). Salary components can be limited to basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only.
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new salary proration changes

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days count before calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working policy, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22 days.
- Calculation results vary depending on month length and selected calculation method; different calculation bases can significantly impact final wage calculations for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are already submitted for employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions before saving new proration settings to ensure changes take effect

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and depends on leave management system for approved leave requests and employee record systems for salary information.
- The Daily Wage Calculator impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It interacts with the company's public holiday calendar and payroll settings to determine accurate daily wage rates.
- Interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions; changes impact employee first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations

Unpaid leave: Leave taken by an employee without compensation, resulting in a salary deduction based on the calculated daily pay rate.
- Calendar days: the number of days in a given month (e.g., 31 in January, 28 in February). Working days: only business days counted, excluding weekends and public holidays set on the company's public holiday calendar. Custom days: flexible calculation base set by payroll managers according to company policies, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law.
- DWC (Daily Wage Calculator): The payroll configuration module where Super admins define salary proration calculation bases. Salary Proration: The proportional adjustment of employee compensation based on actual days worked, affecting first salary and end-of-service settlement.
