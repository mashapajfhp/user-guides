  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily rate. The calculator accounts for leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working day counts. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reduction based on the specific leave period and applicable business rules.

- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation method for the leave policy that will be applied to monthly payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active unpaid payroll amounts

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve leave request, determine leave policy type (calendar or working days), calculate total working days in month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary by actual working days, generate automatic payroll deduction
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), choose salary components to factor into calculations, and apply the configuration.
- 1. Access Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service encashment eligibility.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated transactions, reject those transactions and resave the new proration settings.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. Leave policy can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month are deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days used in calculation
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month: 31 for January, 28 for February), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days for UAE and KSA compliance with labor law). Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select the calculation base.
- Salary component selection limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method selection limited to three options: Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Super admins can configure which specific leave types are eligible for encashment.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated daily and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins have flexibility to choose from multiple calculation and day type options
- Changes affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted, Super admin must reject existing transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the working day count when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working policy, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days
- Calculation results vary depending on month length when using calendar days, and different calculation methods (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) can significantly impact final wage calculations. Companies must ensure their chosen method aligns with applicable labor law requirements.
- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when applying new leave encashment configurations.
- Multiple options are available for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, requiring careful selection based on payroll policy requirements
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist for one or multiple employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then save the new salary proration changes to ensure consistency.

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Interacts with payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions; integrates with leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and employee record systems for salary information
- The Daily Wage Calculator impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It interacts with the company's public holiday calendar and payroll settings to determine which days are counted in wage calculations.
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service calculations, and Leave Management system to customize leave encashment policies that affect end-of-service benefit calculations.
- Interacts with the payroll system by calculating daily deductions that are applied to monthly employee pay; similar to leave encashment functionality
- Interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions; impacts first salary calculations and end-of-service settlement calculations
