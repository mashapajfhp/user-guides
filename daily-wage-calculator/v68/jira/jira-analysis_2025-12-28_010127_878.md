## Glossary

- **Daily Wage Calculator**: Calculated by dividing basic monthly salary by a fixed number of days (platform uses 30 days), used in gratuity and other payroll calculations. [Tickets: TSSD-2648, TSSD-2043, TSSD-4464]
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction**: Calculation of salary reduction for days an employee takes leave without pay, typically computed as (total_salary/30.41) * number of unpaid leave days [Tickets: TSSD-2648, TSSD-1581, TSSD-2532, TSSD-1301, TSSD-1753, TSSD-1807]
- **End of Service (EOS) Gratuity**: A financial benefit calculated based on an employee's total service period, typically computed using daily wage and years of service, with specific rules for different service duration brackets. [Tickets: TSSD-4179, TSSD-2605, TSSD-4742, TSSD-1625, TSSD-2252]
- **Leap Year**: A year containing 366 days instead of the standard 365 days, occurring every 4 years (with some exceptions), which can impact calculations involving days or service periods. [Tickets: TSSD-4179]
- **Pro-rated Amount**: A proportional salary calculation for partial month of work, typically calculated by dividing total salary by 30 and multiplying by days worked [Tickets: TSSD-2605]
- **Leave Accrual Policy**: Method of calculating leave days, which can be monthly (earned at month-end) or conditional (daily earning). [Tickets: TSSD-4742]
- **Service Duration**: Total number of days worked, calculated by counting from start date to departure date, potentially including special considerations like leap year days [Tickets: TSSD-1625]
- **Gratuity Calculation**: End-of-service benefit calculation that uses daily wage, years of service, and specific rate based on employment duration. [Tickets: TSSD-2043]
- **Daily Rate Divisor**: The number of days used to divide the monthly salary to calculate a daily wage rate, which can be configured in the leave policy (e.g., 30 or 31 calendar days). [Tickets: TSSD-4731]
- **Leave Salary Accrual**: Cumulative calculation of vacation leave monetary value, which can vary based on monthly working days configuration [Tickets: TSSD-3648]
- **Daily Wage Proration**: Calculation of daily wage by dividing total monthly salary by a specific number of days (e.g., 30 or 30.42 days). [Tickets: TSSD-2321, TSSD-4292]
- **Leave Salary Calculation**: Method of calculating salary during employee leave periods, typically prorated based on days of leave. [Tickets: TSSD-2321]
- **Prorated Salary**: Partial salary calculation based on actual days worked, typically calculated by dividing monthly salary by total calendar days and multiplying by days present [Tickets: TSSD-3058]
- **Daily Wage Divisor**: A fixed number (30.42) used to calculate the daily wage by dividing monthly salary, instead of using calendar days [Tickets: TSSD-4368]
- **Global Daily Rate Configuration**: A system-wide setting that determines how daily wage deductions are calculated, which takes precedence over individual policy configurations [Tickets: TSSD-1753]
