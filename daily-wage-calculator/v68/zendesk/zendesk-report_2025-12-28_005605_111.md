  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-27  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table based on this calculated daily rate.

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee before daily pay deduction is calculated and reflected on the payroll table.
- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to exclude weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation base.
- Super admin role with access to payroll settings and end-of-service eligibility configuration.
- Access to Leave Settings as a Super Admin; ability to add a new leave policy
- Super admin access to payroll settings and the ability to modify salary proration configuration.

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days or calendar days in the month based on the leave policy, and approved unpaid leave days.
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days.

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, reflected on the payroll table, and the calculated daily pay rate used for the deduction.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and determines which salary components and calculation methods apply to leave encashment.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation that applies daily rates to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method, affecting all active (unpaid) payroll amounts.

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days to arrive at actual working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service encashment eligibility.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at actual working days for calculation purposes.
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Different calculation bases directly impact final wage calculations.
- Salary component selection limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are calendar days, working days, or custom days. Configuration applies to individual leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected when configuring the policy
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When the payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new salary proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days count when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22.
- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation methods produce different wage amounts, so selection of calculation base significantly impacts salary proration and leave encashment outcomes.
- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by new Daily Wage Calculator configurations to prevent unintended policy changes.
- Multiple options are available for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances; administrators must select the appropriate method for their organization's payroll policy
- When payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings.

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and integrates with leave management and employee record systems to process approved unpaid leave requests.
- The Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It interacts with the company's public holiday calendar and payroll settings.
- Interacts with payroll settings, end-of-service eligibility system, and leave management to customize leave encashment policies that affect end-of-service calculations.
- Interacts with the payroll system to apply calculated daily deductions to monthly employee pay; depends on Leave Policies configuration
- Interacts with the Payroll system and Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) module; affects active payroll table transactions and employee compensation calculations.
