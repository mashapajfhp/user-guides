    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table based on this calculated daily rate."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-27\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table based on this calculated daily rate.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control and accuracy. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Allow super admins to configure and customize leave encashment policies for end-of-service calculations, including selection of salary components and calculation methods.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to exclude weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admin role with access to payroll settings and end-of-service eligibility configuration.

[Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Required Inputs\n- Employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days or calendar days in the month based on the leave policy, and approved unpaid leave days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only). [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment.

[Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Procedures\n- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days to arrive at actual working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to include in the calculation. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2.

[Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days) [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at actual working days for calculation purposes. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Different calculation bases directly impact final wage calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component selection limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are calendar days, working days, or custom days. Configuration applies to individual leave types for end-of-service calculations. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected when configuring the policy [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When the payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new salary proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days count when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations.
