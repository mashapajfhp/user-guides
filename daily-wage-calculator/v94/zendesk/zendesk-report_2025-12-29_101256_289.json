    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. The feature supports both calendar days and working days leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, an automatic pay deduction is created and reflected on the payroll table."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-29\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. The feature supports both calendar days and working days leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, an automatic pay deduction is created and reflected on the payroll table.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month.

[Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days. The leave policy determines whether calculation uses calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible basis set by payroll managers). Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options include Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Super admins can configure specific leave types for end-of-service calculations. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay. Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only, Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types (calendar days, working days, custom days). [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted, Super admin must reject existing transactions before saving new proration settings.
