    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculator accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count, and supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table."

The calculator accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count, and supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions with multiple calculation base options.

Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used as the base. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). The selected calculation base directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component selection is limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are restricted to calendar days, working days, or custom days. Leave encashment configuration affects end-of-service calculations. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected during policy configuration [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days count when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working day policy, the daily pay calculation must use 20 days instead of 22 days [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation varies by month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage rates. Different calculation methods produce different final wage calculations, so selection of the appropriate base is critical. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when applying leave encashment configurations. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Multiple calculation method options (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and day type options (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days) are available; selection depends on organizational payroll policy requirements [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and depends on the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and employee salary information [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, public holiday calendar configuration, and leave management systems to calculate accurate daily wage rates for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
