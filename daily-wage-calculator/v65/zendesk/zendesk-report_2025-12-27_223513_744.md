  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-27  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculator accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days count, and supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table.

- Access to Leave Settings configuration as a Super Admin; ability to add a new leave policy
- Access to Settings and Payroll configuration areas; Super admin role required

### Data inputs required

- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and choice of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment configuration.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request that is reflected on the payroll table, and the calculated daily pay rate used for the deduction

- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and determines which paid leave types are eligible for encashment.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation settings that apply daily deductions to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Approve unpaid leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Access Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used as the base. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). The selected calculation base directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts.
- Salary component selection is limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are restricted to calendar days, working days, or custom days. Leave encashment configuration affects end-of-service calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected during policy configuration
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days count when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working day policy, the daily pay calculation must use 20 days instead of 22 days
- Calendar days calculation varies by month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage rates. Different calculation methods produce different final wage calculations, so selection of the appropriate base is critical.
- Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when applying leave encashment configurations.
- Multiple calculation method options (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and day type options (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days) are available; selection depends on organizational payroll policy requirements
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and depends on the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and employee salary information
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, public holiday calendar configuration, and leave management systems to calculate accurate daily wage rates for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with payroll settings, end-of-service calculations, and leave management systems to customize leave encashment policies.
- Interacts with the payroll system by calculating daily deductions that are applied to monthly employee pay; depends on Leave Policies configuration and Leave Settings
- Interacts with Payroll system and payroll table; affects active payroll transactions and employee first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations
