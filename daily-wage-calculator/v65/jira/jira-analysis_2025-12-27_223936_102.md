## Glossary

- **Working Days**: Standard monthly calculation based on 26 working days, derived from 365 total days minus 52 weekly offs, resulting in approximately 26.08 working days per month [Tickets: TSSD-4905, TSSD-3648, TSSD-4292, TSSD-4464, TSSD-1807]
- **End of Service (EOS) Gratuity**: End of service benefit calculated based on an employee's basic salary, length of service, and contract type, typically using a formula of daily wage multiplied by days per year based on total service duration [Tickets: TSSD-4179, TSSD-2605, TSSD-4742, TSSD-1625, TSSD-2252]
- **Leap Year Divisor**: A year containing 366 days instead of the standard 365 days, occurring every 4 years (with some exceptions), which can impact calculations involving days or service periods. [Tickets: TSSD-4179, TSSD-2252]
- **Pro-rated Amount**: A proportional salary calculation for partial periods, typically computed by dividing total salary by 30 days and multiplying by days worked [Tickets: TSSD-2605]
- **Monthly Accrual Policy**: Leave days are earned and granted at the end of each month, meaning incomplete months do not generate leave balance. [Tickets: TSSD-4742]
- **Conditional Accrual Policy**: Leave days are earned daily instead of monthly, allowing more flexible leave balance calculation for partial months. [Tickets: TSSD-4742]
- **Service Duration**: Total number of working days calculated from employment start to departure date, including potential leap year considerations and departure date inclusion [Tickets: TSSD-1625]
- **Daily Wage Proration**: The method of calculating a proportional daily wage based on the total monthly salary, typically by dividing the monthly salary by a standard number of days (e.g., 30 or 30.42). [Tickets: TSSD-2252, TSSD-2043, TSSD-2321, TSSD-4464]
- **Gratuity Calculation**: End-of-service benefit calculation based on years worked, daily wage, and specific service brackets (e.g., 21 days per year for 1-5 years of service). [Tickets: TSSD-2043]
- **Daily Rate Divisor**: The number of days used to divide the monthly salary to calculate a daily wage rate, which can be configured in the leave policy (e.g., 30 or 31 calendar days). [Tickets: TSSD-4731, TSSD-1301]
- **Prorated Salary**: A salary calculation method that adjusts the full monthly salary proportionally based on the actual days worked or on leave, using a predefined daily rate divisor. [Tickets: TSSD-4731]
- **Leave Salary Accrual**: The cumulative calculation of vacation leave monetary value across months, which can vary based on working days configuration [Tickets: TSSD-3648]
- **Leave Salary Calculation**: Determining the salary amount for periods of employee leave, which may use a different calculation method than regular salary proration. [Tickets: TSSD-2321]
- **Daily Wage Divisor**: A system-configured value (30.42 days) used to calculate the daily rate for salary deductions, which differs from standard calendar days [Tickets: TSSD-4368]
- **Unpaid Leave Deduction**: Calculation of salary deduction for days an employee was absent without pay, computed as (Basic + Allowances) / Working Days × Number of Unpaid Days [Tickets: TSSD-1301, TSSD-1807]
