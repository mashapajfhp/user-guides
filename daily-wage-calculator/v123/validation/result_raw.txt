Observable elements correctly identify expected calculation base options and explicitly note absence of automation features. This is a negative validation (confirming feature does not exist) which is logically sound.","navigation_validity":"valid","observable_elements_validity":"valid"},{"issue_id":"VAL-002","validation_result":"claim_consistent","confidence":"high","rationale":"Hypothesis validates basic UI structure and availability of three calculation base options. Observable elements align with documented feature functionality.

One navigation path requires clarification (VAL-007: 'Payroll table' lacks specific navigation hierarchy). All observable elements are logically valid. Claims cover core functionality validation (calculation bases, salary components), configuration areas (End of Service, Leave Policies, salary proration), integration points (public holidays, cross-functional impact), transaction workflows (rejection when payroll open), and security (role-based access control). No contradictions or invalid hypotheses detected."}
