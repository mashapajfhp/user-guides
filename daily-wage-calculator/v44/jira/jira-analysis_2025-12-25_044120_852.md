## Known Issue

### Global Daily Rate Configuration Overrides Policy Settings

**Statement:** The system applies a global daily rate configuration that supersedes individual leave policy calculations, potentially causing incorrect unpaid leave deductions by using gross salary instead of basic salary.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_001 | playwright=YES | ui=YES | test_data=YES | limitation_type=configuration_override

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-1753

**Preconditions:**

- Navigate to the feature area relevant to this claim

- Fallback: locate by visible text labels and section headings

### Unpaid Leave Deduction Persistence After Deletion

**Statement:** When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Deleting the leave request does not remove associated payroll deductions.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_002 | playwright=NO | test_data=YES | limitation_type=data_inconsistency | blocker=ASYNC_RECALC_OR_TXN_LIFECYCLE

### Proration Failure for Future Departure Dates

**Statement:** The daily wage calculator fails to correctly prorate salaries for employees with future departure dates during payroll processing. When an employee's departure date is set in the future (e.g., Nov 28th) but payroll is processed earlier (e.g., Nov 27th), the system fails to prorate the salary and displays the full monthly amount instead. The system correctly prorates when the departure date is in the past, but not when it's in the future relative to the payroll processing date.

### Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Mismatch

**Statement:** The system experiences data synchronization issues between Time Off and Payroll modules when public holidays are added after leave requests are created. This causes inconsistent daily wage calculations that cannot be retroactively corrected.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_004 | playwright=NO | test_data=YES | limitation_type=data_inconsistency | blocker=ASYNC_RECALC_OR_TXN_LIFECYCLE

### Lack of Automated Daily Wage Calculation

**Statement:** The current system lacks automated salary calculation based on actual working days, requiring manual interventions and separate tracking of overtime and unpaid leaves.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_005 | playwright=YES | ui=YES | test_data=YES | limitation_type=feature_gap

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-4905

**Preconditions:**

### Incorrect Daily Rate Month Display

**Statement:** The system shows the daily rate from the payroll processing month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate is from the wrong month.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_006 | playwright=YES | ui=YES | test_data=YES | limitation_type=ui_display_issue

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-1807

### Days Worked Calculation Inconsistency

**Statement:** Platform calculates total job tenure with a potential extra day (623 days vs expected 622 days). Daily wage calculation uses a fixed 30-day divisor, which may not align with all client expectations of daily wage computation.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_007 | playwright=NO | ui=YES | test_data=YES | limitation_type=calculation_method | blocker=BACKEND_ORACLE_REQUIRED

**Selector hints:**
- Prefer data-testid selectors (or stable automation IDs) where available
- Fallback: locate by visible text labels and section headings

### Gratuity Calculation Complexity

**Statement:** The daily wage calculator's gratuity calculation involves complex logic for handling partial years of service, especially for periods above 5 years. The system uses specific rules for calculating service duration, including leap year adjustments and day counting methodologies that may not be immediately intuitive to users.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_008 | playwright=YES | ui=YES | test_data=YES | limitation_type=calculation_complexity

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-4742, TSSD-2252

**Selector hints:**
- Prefer data-testid selectors (or stable automation IDs) where available
- Fallback: locate by visible text labels and section headings

### Leave Salary Proration Calculation Discrepancy

**Statement:** The system calculates leave salary and salary proration using independent daily wage configurations with different divisors (30 vs 30.42 days), causing calculation mismatches. This means the leave salary and salary proration use separate formulas, leading to inconsistent results.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_009 | playwright=NO | ui=YES | test_data=YES | limitation_type=configuration_problem | blocker=BACKEND_ORACLE_REQUIRED

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-2321

### End of Service Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Error

**Statement:** Daily wage calculation for pro-rated amounts consistently produces amounts less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals. The formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but results in systematic undercalculation affecting all employees' end of service settlements.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_010 | playwright=NO | ui=YES | test_data=YES | limitation_type=calculation_bug | blocker=BACKEND_ORACLE_REQUIRED

### Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Daily Wage Formula

**Statement:** The daily wage calculator in payroll settings intentionally overrides the leave policy formula for unpaid leave. The greyed-out formula in leave policy indicates this override, causing user confusion about which formula is actually applied.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_011 | playwright=NO | ui=YES | limitation_type=ux_issue | blocker=BACKEND_ORACLE_REQUIRED

**Evidence (tickets):** TSSD-2648

**Selector hints:**

- Fallback: locate by visible text labels and section headings

### Leave Salary Accrual Report Calculation Inconsistency

**Statement:** The daily wage calculator's 'working days' setting causes monthly fluctuations in leave salary accrual calculations. The daily wage rate changes based on the number of working days in each month, leading to inconsistent cumulative totals.

### Gratuity Calculation Discrepancy with Leap Year Days

**Statement:** The system's gratuity calculation may not consistently handle leap year days (February 29th), causing minor discrepancies in total service days and resulting gratuity amount. The system calculated 912 days, while manual calculation showed 913 days by including the leap day.
