    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay rates for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides an employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the appropriate per-day compensation amount. The calculator accounts for different leave policies (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from the working day count. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary deductions for unpaid leave across the organization."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay rates for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides an employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the appropriate per-day compensation amount. The calculator accounts for different leave policies (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from the working day count. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary deductions for unpaid leave across the organization.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of actual working days or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control and regional compliance.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation uses actual number of days in a given month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February) ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as configured in the company's public holiday calendar ; Custom days allow payroll managers flexibility to set calculation base according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with local labor law [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration settings affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new proration changes. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- When public holidays fall within the month, they must be subtracted from the working days count before calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 days are public holidays and the leave policy is 22 working days, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days. ; Different leave policies (calendar days vs. working days) will produce different daily pay calculations for the same salary amount; ensure the correct policy is applied for each employee. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation results vary depending on month length when using calendar days basis, which can impact final wage amounts for salary proration and leave encashment ; Different calculation bases (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) can produce significantly different daily wage rates and should be selected carefully to match company policy and regional labor law requirements [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then resave the salary proration changes to avoid conflicts.
