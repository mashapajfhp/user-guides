  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-25  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay rates for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides an employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the appropriate per-day compensation amount. The calculator accounts for different leave policies (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from the working day count. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary deductions for unpaid leave across the organization.

## Knowledge Extract

### Job to be done

- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of actual working days or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays.
- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control and regional compliance.
- To adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement by selecting appropriate calculation bases (custom days, calendar days, or working days).

### Primary personas

- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave requests, approving unpaid leave, and processing salary calculations.

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Generation → Payroll Table Reflection — _Process flow for handling unpaid leave and reflecting daily pay deductions in payroll_
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point to the Daily Wage Calculator feature | Primary navigation to access salary proration settings and calculation basis selection_

### Prerequisites

- Unpaid leave request must be approved before daily pay deduction is automatically created and reflected on payroll. ; Leave policy must be defined as either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) to determine calculation basis.
- User must have Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator ; Company public holiday calendar must be configured to support working days calculation base
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount ; Number of actual working days or calendar days in the month ; Public holidays falling in the month — _Sum of basic salary and allowances used as numerator in daily pay calculation. ; Denominator for daily pay calculation; determined by leave policy (calendar days or working days policy). ; Public holidays are deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days for calculation._
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components to include — _User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (total days in a given month), working days (business days excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined number of days) ; User must choose which salary components to factor into calculations: basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only_
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days_

### Outputs and results

- Calculated daily pay rate ; Automatic pay deduction reflected on payroll table — _Derived from formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. ; Upon approval of unpaid leave request, an automatic pay deduction associated with the specific request is created and reflected on the payroll table._
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System generates daily wage calculations used for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction based on selected calculation base and salary components_
- Updated salary calculations — _Proportionally adjusted employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** — _When an unpaid leave request has been approved and a pay deduction needs to be calculated and applied to an employee's salary._
  - Receive and approve unpaid leave request
  - Determine applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days)
  - Identify total days in the policy (e.g., 30 calendar days or 22 working days)
  - Identify public holidays falling in the month
  - Subtract public holidays from the policy days to get actual working days
  - Calculate daily pay using formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Actual working days
  - System automatically generates pay deduction and reflects it on payroll table
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up or modifying daily wage calculation methodology for payroll processing_
  - Access Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days
  - Choose salary components to include in calculation (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only)
  - System applies selected configuration to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations
- **Update Salary Proration** — _When Super admin needs to change how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked_
  - Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation
  - Select the required calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days
  - Save changes
  - If payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, reject the existing transactions before saving new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay formula is: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. ; The number of days used in calculation is either calendar days (if following calendar days leave policy, e.g., 30 days) or working days (if following working days leave policy, e.g., 22 working days). ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the daily pay calculation. ; Pay deduction is automatically created and reflected on the payroll table only upon approval of the unpaid leave request.
- Calendar days calculation uses actual number of days in a given month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February) ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as configured in the company's public holiday calendar ; Custom days allow payroll managers flexibility to set calculation base according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with local labor law
- Changes to salary proration settings affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new proration changes.

### Edge cases and warnings

- When public holidays fall within the month, they must be subtracted from the working days count before calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 days are public holidays and the leave policy is 22 working days, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days. ; Different leave policies (calendar days vs. working days) will produce different daily pay calculations for the same salary amount; ensure the correct policy is applied for each employee.
- Calculation results vary depending on month length when using calendar days basis, which can impact final wage amounts for salary proration and leave encashment ; Different calculation bases (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) can produce significantly different daily wage rates and should be selected carefully to match company policy and regional labor law requirements
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then resave the salary proration changes to avoid conflicts.

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Integrates with leave management system to receive and process unpaid leave requests and approvals. ; Integrates with payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; Depends on employee record system to retrieve salary information (basic salary and allowances). ; Depends on calendar system to identify public holidays for the month in which daily pay is being calculated.
- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations within the payroll system ; Depends on company public holiday calendar configuration to accurately calculate working days when that calculation base is selected
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly affects active payroll table transactions; changes to proration settings cascade to all unpaid payroll amounts.
