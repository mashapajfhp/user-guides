## Known Issue

### Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation

**Statement:** System failed to recalculate pending unpaid leave deductions when new salary configurations were created after leave request submission. Deductions were incorrectly based on previous salary configuration instead of current one, resulting in payroll calculation discrepancies.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_001 | playwright=NO | test_data=YES | limitation_type=calculation_bug | blocker=ASYNC_RECALC_OR_TXN_LIFECYCLE

- Fallback: locate by visible text labels and section headings

### Incorrect Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation

**Statement:** The system applies a global daily rate configuration that overrides individual policy-specific leave calculation methods. Unpaid leave deductions are calculated using a global setting instead of policy-defined basic salary / working days method, potentially leading to incorrect salary deductions.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_002 | playwright=YES | test_data=YES | limitation_type=configuration_override

### Duplicate Payroll Deductions After Leave Recalculation

**Statement:** When an unpaid leave request is approved and transaction submitted, then the daily wage calculation is changed and the transaction deleted to recalculate, the system creates duplicate deductions—one with the old calculation and one with the new. Deleting the leave request does not remove associated payroll deductions.

**Meta:** id=JIRA_003 | playwright=NO | test_data=YES | limitation_type=data_inconsistency | blocker=ASYNC_RECALC_OR_TXN_LIFECYCLE

### Unpaid Leave Deduction Calculation Mismatch

**Statement:** When public holidays are added after a leave request is created, the daily wage calculation becomes inconsistent between Payroll and Time Off modules. This causes incorrect salary deduction amounts that cannot be retroactively corrected.

### Lack of Automated Salary Calculation

**Statement:** Current system cannot automatically calculate salary based on actual working days, requiring manual interventions and separate tracking of overtime and unpaid leaves.

### Gratuity Calculation Leap Year Handling

**Statement:** System potentially miscalculates service duration by not consistently handling leap year days (February 29th) when computing total service days for gratuity calculation. The calculation method involves dividing total service days by 365, which can create minor discrepancies when leap years are involved.

### Incorrect Daily Rate Month Display

**Statement:** The system shows the daily rate from the payroll processing month (May) instead of the leave occurrence month (April), causing user confusion. The actual deduction amount is calculated correctly, but the displayed daily rate is inconsistent with the leave period.

### Gratuity Calculation Methodology Nuances

**Statement:** The daily wage calculator's gratuity calculation involves complex logic for handling partial years of service, especially for periods above 5 years. The system uses different calculation approaches for complete and incomplete years, including specific handling for leap years by using 366 as a divisor when applicable.

### Leave Salary Calculation Inconsistency

**Statement:** The system uses different divisors for leave salary and salary proration calculations. Leave salary uses a 30-day divisor, while salary proration uses a 30.42-day divisor, causing calculation discrepancies.

### End of Service Pro-Rated Amount Calculation Error

**Statement:** End of Service (EOS) calculation is producing incorrect pro-rated amounts due to a rounding or decimal precision error. The daily wage formula (basic + allowances / 30) is configured correctly, but when calculating pro-rated EOS amounts, the system consistently shows amounts that are less than expected by 0.1 or 0.2 decimals.

### Payroll Settings Override Leave Policy Formula

**Statement:** The daily wage calculator in payroll settings intentionally overrides the formula configured in the leave policy for unpaid leave. The leave policy formula appears greyed out, indicating it will not be used. This creates user confusion about which formula is actually being applied for daily wage calculations.

### Incorrect Salary Proration for Offboarded Employees

**Statement:** The daily wage calculator fails to correctly prorate salary when an employee's departure date is in the future relative to payroll processing date. The system only correctly prorates salaries when departure dates are in the past.

### End of Service Gratuity Calculation Incorrect for Leap Years

**Statement:** The system incorrectly calculates service days by using 365 days instead of 366 days for 2024, resulting in an inaccurate gratuity amount. When calculating End of Service (EOS) gratuity, the system fails to recognize 2024 as a leap year, causing a calculation discrepancy of approximately AED 17.26.
