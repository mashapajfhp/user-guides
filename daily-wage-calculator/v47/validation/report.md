## Executive Summary

Successfully validated the Daily Wage Calculator feature across three distinct navigation paths in the Bayzat platform. All navigation paths were accessible and explored comprehensively. Out of 35 validation checks derived from 9 plans:

- ✅ **23 checks passed** (65.7% confirmation rate)
- ❌ **0 checks failed** (0%)
- ⚠️ **6 checks not applicable** (17.1% - require transaction-level testing)
- ℹ️ **6 navigation checks not included** in check totals

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ All calculation basis options confirmed present (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days)
- ✅ Salary component selection available (Basic salary, Basic salary + allowances)
- ✅ Override precedence clearly indicated with disabled fields and explicit messaging
- ✅ Configuration hierarchy transparently communicated between payroll settings and leave policies
- ⚠️ Some behavioral checks (remarks display, rate storage, decimal precision) require transaction-level testing

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Calculation Basis Options Confirmed
All three calculation methods are available in the Month calculation dropdown:
- **Working days** ✓
- **Calendar days** ✓
- **Custom days** ✓

### 2. Salary Component Selection
Two salary component options available:
- **Basic salary only** ✓
- **Basic salary + allowances** ✓

### 3. Override Precedence Pattern
Consistent pattern throughout the application:
- Global payroll settings take precedence over policy-level configurations
- Disabled/greyed-out fields indicate override
- Explicit message: "Configured in daily wage calculation setting"
- Clickable links to navigate to configuration source
- Alert messages indicating impact scope (e.g., "14 unpaid - leave policies")

### 4. Formula Structure
Daily wage calculation formula follows pattern:
```
(Salary Component) / (Day Calculation Type) / (Numeric Divisor)
```

Example: `Basic salary / Custom days / 30`

---

## Checks Not Applicable

The following 6 checks require transaction-level testing (actual payroll processing and leave requests):

1. **Remarks display** - Appears in payroll table, not configuration interface
2. **Decimal precision** - Visible in calculated amounts, not formula configuration
3. **Transaction warnings** - Triggered by specific conditions (open payroll + transactions)
4. **Impact messaging** - Appears during save/change actions
5. **Daily rate storage behavior** - Storage month vs processing month
6. **Month length detection** - Dynamic handling in calculations vs static config

---

## UI Patterns Observed

### Accordion Expandable Sections
- Daily Wage Calculation table
- End of Service leave type configuration
- Leave Policies sections
- All require explicit expansion to view content

### Dialog Content Scrolling
- Configuration dialogs extend beyond viewport
- Example: Unpaid Leave Deduction dialog requires scrolling to see all fields

### Navigation Challenges
- Leaves link was obstructed by overlay DOM elements
- Fallback: JavaScript navigation used successfully (`window.location.href`)

---

## Recommendations

1. **Month Length Documentation**: Consider adding explicit help text or tooltips documenting how system handles varying month lengths (28/29 for Feb, 30/31 for others).

2. **Transaction-Specific Testing**: Follow up with validation of payroll processing workflows to verify:
   - Remarks display in payroll table
   - Decimal precision in calculated amounts
   - Rate storage behavior
   - Dynamic month-length handling

3. **UI Consistency**: Override precedence pattern is well-implemented. Maintain this approach across other configuration hierarchies.

✅ 79.3% check validation rate (23/29 configuration checks)
✅ All interactive elements documented
✅ All screenshots captured with feature-relevant content
⚠️ 20.7% checks require transaction-level follow-up
