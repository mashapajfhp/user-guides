  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-25  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system component that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the daily pay rate by dividing the employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays and the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days). When an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates and reflects the corresponding pay deduction on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary reductions based on the specific leave policy framework in use.

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Generation → Payroll Table Reflection — _The workflow begins when an unpaid leave request is submitted, moves through approval, and concludes with automatic deduction creation and payroll system reflection._
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point for Daily Wage Calculator configuration. | Primary navigation to access Daily Wage Calculator configuration interface_

### Prerequisites

- An unpaid leave request must be submitted and approved before the daily wage calculator can generate pay deductions. ; The organization must have a defined leave policy (either calendar days or working days based) to determine the denominator for daily pay calculation. ; Employee salary information (basic salary and allowances) must be available in the system prior to calculation.
- User must have Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor role to access and configure Daily Wage Calculator settings. ; Company must have a configured public holiday calendar if using working days calculation method.
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) ; Number of Actual Working Days in the Month ; Public Holiday Schedule ; Leave Policy Type — _The total salary comprising the employee's basic salary and any applicable allowances, used as the numerator in the daily pay calculation formula. ; The total number of working days in the month, which may be derived from either a calendar days policy (e.g., 30 days) or a working days policy (e.g., 22 days), adjusted by subtracting public holidays. ; Dates of public holidays falling within the month, which must be deducted from the working days count to arrive at the actual working days used in the denominator. ; Specification of whether the organization follows a calendar days leave policy or a working days leave policy to determine the baseline number of days._
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components to include — _User must select one of three calculation methods: calendar days (total days in the month), working days (business days excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined number of days, commonly 30 for UAE and KSA compliance). ; User must choose which salary components to factor into calculations: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only._
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days to determine how salary proration is calculated_

### Outputs and results

- Automatic Pay Deduction ; Daily Pay Rate ; Payroll Table Reflection — _Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically creates a pay deduction associated with the specific request. ; The calculated daily pay amount derived from the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of Actual Working Days in the Month, reflected on the payroll table. ; The automatic pay deduction is reflected on the payroll table, making it visible to payroll administrators and employees._
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System generates daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations based on the selected calculation base and salary components._
- Updated salary calculations — _System recalculates and applies proportional salary adjustments to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table based on the selected calculation method_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** — _When an unpaid leave request has been approved and a salary deduction needs to be calculated and applied to the employee's payroll._
  - Receive and approve an unpaid leave request from an employee
  - Identify the leave policy type in use (calendar days or working days)
  - Determine the baseline number of days (e.g., 30 for calendar days, 22 for working days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling within the month
  - Subtract the number of public holidays from the baseline days to calculate actual working days
  - Retrieve the employee's salary amount (basic salary plus allowances)
  - Apply the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of Actual Working Days
  - Automatically generate and reflect the pay deduction on the payroll table
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up or modifying how daily wages are calculated for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions._
  - Navigate to Settings menu
  - Select Payroll section
  - Choose Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days
  - Choose salary components to include in the calculation
  - Apply and save configuration
- **Update Salary Proration** — _When adjusting how employee salaries should be prorated based on days worked, or when payroll configuration needs to change calculation methodology_
  - Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation
  - Select the required calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days
  - Save changes
  - If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions first, then save the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing the total salary amount (basic salary plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month. ; The number of days used in the calculation can be either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if following a calendar days leave policy, or working days (e.g., 22 days) if following a working days leave policy. ; Public holidays falling within the month must be deducted from the working days count to arrive at the actual working days for the calculation denominator. ; The pay deduction is automatically created and associated with the specific unpaid leave request upon approval.
- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which directly affects daily wage rates. ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Custom days calculation allows payroll table managers to set a fixed number of days according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with local labor law.
- Changes to salary proration settings will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon save ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the existing prorated salary transactions before saving new salary proration changes

### Edge cases and warnings

- When public holidays fall within the month, they must be explicitly deducted from the working days count. For example, if two days are public holidays and the leave policy is based on 22 working days, the daily pay calculation must use 20 days (22 - 2) as the denominator, not the baseline 22 days. ; The calculation method differs based on the organization's leave policy framework. Organizations using a calendar days policy will have a different denominator than those using a working days policy, which can result in different daily pay rates for the same salary amount.
- Monthly variation in calendar days affects daily wage calculations; months with different numbers of days (28, 30, or 31) will produce different daily wage rates when using calendar days calculation method. ; Different calculation methods (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) will produce significantly different daily wage rates and impact final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts.
- When payroll month is open with active prorated salary transactions, Super admin cannot directly save new proration settings; must first reject existing transactions, then save the changes to apply new calculation methodology

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The feature depends on the employee record system to retrieve salary information (basic salary and allowances) and on the organization's configured leave policy (calendar days or working days) to determine the calculation denominator. ; The feature requires integration with a public holiday calendar or configuration to accurately identify and exclude public holidays from the working days count.
- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three downstream payroll processes: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations. ; Depends on company's public holiday calendar configuration when working days calculation method is selected.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly affects payroll table transactions, including first salary calculations and end-of-service settlements
