    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system component that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the daily pay rate by dividing the employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays and the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days). When an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates and reflects the corresponding pay deduction on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary reductions based on the specific leave policy framework in use."

It defines the daily pay formula as Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by the number of actual working days in the month. The article clarifies that the number of days can be either calendar days (e.g., 30) or working days (e.g., 22) depending on the organization's leave policy, and that public holidays must be deducted from the working days count. It provides a concrete example showing how 2 public holidays would reduce 22 working days to 20 actual working days for calculation purposes. The feature automatically creates and reflects pay deductions on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system component that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the daily pay rate by dividing the employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays and the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days). When an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates and reflects the corresponding pay deduction on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary reductions based on the specific leave policy framework in use.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and automatically deduct daily pay from employee salaries when unpaid leave is approved, ensuring accurate salary reduction based on the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, with public holidays properly excluded from the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages that affects salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, allowing companies to align calculations with their specific policies and regional labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement by selecting appropriate calculation bases (custom days, calendar days, or working days).

The number of days used in the calculation can be either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if following a calendar days leave policy, or working days (e.g., 22 days) if following a working days leave policy. ; Public holidays falling within the month must be deducted from the working days count to arrive at the actual working days for the calculation denominator. ; The pay deduction is automatically created and associated with the specific unpaid leave request upon approval. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which directly affects daily wage rates. ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Custom days calculation allows payroll table managers to set a fixed number of days according to company policies; most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with local labor law. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration settings will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon save ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the existing prorated salary transactions before saving new salary proration changes [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- When public holidays fall within the month, they must be explicitly deducted from the working days count. For example, if two days are public holidays and the leave policy is based on 22 working days, the daily pay calculation must use 20 days (22 - 2) as the denominator, not the baseline 22 days. ; The calculation method differs based on the organization's leave policy framework. Organizations using a calendar days policy will have a different denominator than those using a working days policy, which can result in different daily pay rates for the same salary amount. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Monthly variation in calendar days affects daily wage calculations; months with different numbers of days (28, 30, or 31) will produce different daily wage rates when using calendar days calculation method. ; Different calculation methods (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) will produce significantly different daily wage rates and impact final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open with active prorated salary transactions, Super admin cannot directly save new proration settings; must first reject existing transactions, then save the changes to apply new calculation methodology [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator interacts with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The feature depends on the employee record system to retrieve salary information (basic salary and allowances) and on the organization's configured leave policy (calendar days or working days) to determine the calculation denominator. ; The feature requires integration with a public holiday calendar or configuration to accurately identify and exclude public holidays from the working days count. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three downstream payroll processes: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations. ; Depends on company's public holiday calendar configuration when working days calculation method is selected. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly affects payroll table transactions, including first salary calculations and end-of-service settlements [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Glossary Terms\n- Daily Pay ; Actual Working Days ; Unpaid Leave ; Leave Policy ; Public Holiday: The calculated daily salary rate used to deduct unpaid leave days from an employee's salary, computed as Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by the number of actual working days in the month. ; The number of working days in a month after deducting public holidays from the baseline working days count (e.g., 22 working days minus 2 public holidays equals 20 actual working days). ; A leave type where an approved absence results in an automatic salary deduction calculated using the daily wage calculator based on the number of unpaid leave days taken. ; An organizational framework that defines whether leave is calculated based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days), which determines the denominator used in daily pay calculations. ; A designated non-working day (e.g., National Day) that must be deducted from the working days count when calculating the actual working days for daily pay computation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days ; Working days ; Custom days ; Salary proration ; Leave encashment ; Unpaid leave deduction: The number of days in a given month; for example, 31 days in January and 28 days in February. ; Only business days counted in the calculation; weekends and public holidays set up on the company's public holiday calendar do not count. ; A flexible calculation base that allows payroll table managers to set the calculation base according to company policies; most companies in UAE and KSA set custom days as 30 to comply with labor law. ; Calculation of proportional salary amounts based on the daily wage rate; one of three main areas impacted by Daily Wage Calculator. ; Calculation of monetary value for unused leave based on the daily wage rate; one of three main areas impacted by Daily Wage Calculator. ; Calculation of salary deductions for unpaid leave based on the daily wage rate; one of three main areas impacted by Daily Wage Calculator.
