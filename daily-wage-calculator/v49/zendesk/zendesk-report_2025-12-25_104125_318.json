    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the daily pay rate by dividing an employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays and the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days). Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates and reflects the corresponding pay deduction on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary calculations across the organization's leave management processes."

The article clarifies that the number of days can be either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) based on the organization's leave policy, and that public holidays must be deducted from working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation. It provides an example showing how 2 public holidays reduce 22 working days to 20 actual working days for the daily pay calculation."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the daily pay rate by dividing an employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays and the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days). Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates and reflects the corresponding pay deduction on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary calculations across the organization's leave management processes.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of actual working days or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control and regional compliance. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement by selecting appropriate calculation bases (custom days, calendar days, or working days). [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Primary Personas\n- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave requests and processing salary calculations.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- User must have Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator. ; Company must have a configured public holiday calendar to accurately exclude public holidays when using working days calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- User must have Super admin role to access and modify Daily Wage Calculator settings.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects monthly wage calculations. ; Working days calculation automatically excludes weekends and public holidays as configured in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Custom days calculation base allows flexibility for company-specific policies; most UAE and KSA companies set custom days to 30 to comply with regional labor law requirements. ; Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select and modify the calculation base for daily wages. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration settings will have an effect on all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new proration settings changes. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days count; failure to do so will result in incorrect daily pay calculations. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the actual working days should be 20, not 22. ; The leave policy type (calendar days vs. working days) significantly impacts the daily pay calculation; ensure the correct policy is applied before calculating. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation results vary significantly depending on the month length when using calendar days; February has fewer days than other months, which impacts daily wage calculations. ; Different calculation methods (calendar, working, or custom days) can produce substantially different final wage amounts for the same salary components; selection must align with company policy and regional labor law. ; Working days calculation depends on accurate public holiday calendar configuration; missing or incorrect public holidays will result in incorrect daily wage calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have already been submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then resave the new salary proration changes to avoid conflicts or incorrect calculations. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator integrates with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and with the payroll system to automatically generate and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The feature depends on the employee record system to retrieve employee salary information (basic salary and allowances) and the calendar system to identify public holidays. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three interconnected payroll areas: salary proration calculations, leave encashment payments, and unpaid leave deductions. ; Feature depends on the company's public holiday calendar configuration to accurately calculate working days and exclude non-business days from wage calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly affects active payroll table transactions; changes to proration settings cascade to all unpaid payroll amounts.
