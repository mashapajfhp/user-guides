  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-25  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates the daily pay rate by dividing an employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays and the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days). Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates and reflects the corresponding pay deduction on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary calculations across the organization's leave management processes.

## Knowledge Extract

### Job to be done

- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of actual working days or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays.
- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control and regional compliance.
- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement by selecting appropriate calculation bases (custom days, calendar days, or working days).

### Primary personas

- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave requests and processing salary calculations.

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Generation → Payroll Table Reflection — _The workflow begins when an unpaid leave request is submitted, approved, and then automatically triggers pay deduction calculations reflected in the payroll system._
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point to the Daily Wage Calculator feature for configuration and setup. | Primary navigation path to access the Daily Wage Calculator configuration interface where Super admins can update salary proration settings._

### Prerequisites

- An unpaid leave request must be approved before pay deduction calculations are automatically initiated. ; The organization's leave policy must be defined as either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days).
- User must have Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator. ; Company must have a configured public holiday calendar to accurately exclude public holidays when using working days calculation base.
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify Daily Wage Calculator settings.

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount ; Number of actual working days or calendar days in the month ; Public holidays occurring in the month — _Comprises basic salary plus allowances, used as the numerator in the daily pay calculation formula. ; Determined by the organization's leave policy; used as the denominator in the daily pay calculation formula. ; Public holidays are deducted from the working days count to arrive at the actual working days for calculation purposes._
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components to include — _User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (total days in month), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined number of days, typically 30 for UAE/KSA compliance). ; User must choose which salary components to factor into calculations: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only._
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days to determine how salary proration is calculated._

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction amount ; Daily pay rate — _The calculated daily pay rate multiplied by the number of unpaid leave days, automatically created and reflected on the payroll table upon approval of the unpaid leave request. ; The result of dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, used to determine the deduction amount._
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System generates daily wage rates that are applied to three main areas: salary proration (prorated salary calculations), leave encashment (payment for unused leave), and unpaid leave deduction (deductions for unpaid leave taken)._
- Updated salary calculations — _Proportionally adjusted employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table._

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** — _When an unpaid leave request has been approved and a pay deduction needs to be calculated and reflected in the payroll system._
  - Receive and approve the unpaid leave request
  - Determine the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days)
  - Identify the total number of days in the leave policy (e.g., 22 working days or 30 calendar days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling in the month for which daily pay is being calculated
  - Subtract the number of public holidays from the total working days to arrive at actual working days
  - Calculate daily pay using the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Actual Working Days
  - Automatically generate and reflect the pay deduction on the payroll table
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up or modifying daily wage calculation methodology for the organization._
  - Navigate to Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select the calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days
  - Choose salary components to include in the calculation (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only)
  - Confirm and save the configuration
  - System applies the selected calculation method to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions
- **Update Salary Proration Settings** — _When organization needs to change how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked, or to adjust calculation methodology for first salaries and end-of-service settlements._
  - Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation
  - Select the desired calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days
  - Save the changes
  - If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions first, then save the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing the total salary amount (basic salary plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month. ; The leave policy determines whether calculations use calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the basis. ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to determine the actual working days used in the daily pay calculation. ; Pay deductions are only created and reflected on the payroll table upon approval of an unpaid leave request; they are generated automatically.
- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects monthly wage calculations. ; Working days calculation automatically excludes weekends and public holidays as configured in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Custom days calculation base allows flexibility for company-specific policies; most UAE and KSA companies set custom days to 30 to comply with regional labor law requirements. ; Only Superadmin, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select and modify the calculation base for daily wages.
- Changes to salary proration settings will have an effect on all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new proration settings changes.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days count; failure to do so will result in incorrect daily pay calculations. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the actual working days should be 20, not 22. ; The leave policy type (calendar days vs. working days) significantly impacts the daily pay calculation; ensure the correct policy is applied before calculating.
- Calculation results vary significantly depending on the month length when using calendar days; February has fewer days than other months, which impacts daily wage calculations. ; Different calculation methods (calendar, working, or custom days) can produce substantially different final wage amounts for the same salary components; selection must align with company policy and regional labor law. ; Working days calculation depends on accurate public holiday calendar configuration; missing or incorrect public holidays will result in incorrect daily wage calculations.
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have already been submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then resave the new salary proration changes to avoid conflicts or incorrect calculations.

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator integrates with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and with the payroll system to automatically generate and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The feature depends on the employee record system to retrieve employee salary information (basic salary and allowances) and the calendar system to identify public holidays.
- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three interconnected payroll areas: salary proration calculations, leave encashment payments, and unpaid leave deductions. ; Feature depends on the company's public holiday calendar configuration to accurately calculate working days and exclude non-business days from wage calculations.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly affects active payroll table transactions; changes to proration settings cascade to all unpaid payroll amounts.
