  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-27  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees who take unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the total working days. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.

- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation to access salary proration configuration

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee before daily pay deduction is calculated and reflected on payroll.

- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator.
- Access to Leave Settings configuration as a Super Admin user
- Super admin access level required to modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days or calendar days in the month based on leave policy, and public holidays falling within the month.
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and choice of salary components to include (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), selection of calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and configuration of eligible leave types for encashment.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, calculated daily pay rate, and deduction reflected on the payroll table.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and determines which salary components and calculation methods apply to leave encashment.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation settings that apply daily deductions to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to factor into calculations.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types eligible for encashment.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation; 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days); 3. Save changes; 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated transactions, reject those transactions and resave the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) divided by Number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to arrive at actual working days.
- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days, working days, or custom days. Working days exclude weekends and public holidays from the company's public holiday calendar. Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with labor law requirements. Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February).
- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method selection is limited to three options: Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Super admins can only overwrite leave encashment policies through the Daily Wage Calculator.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated daily and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins must choose from predefined calculation methods and day calculation types
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted, Super admin must reject existing transactions before saving new proration settings

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22.
- Calculation results vary depending on month length and selected calculation method. Different calculation bases can produce significantly different daily wage amounts, affecting salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction outcomes.
- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when configuring leave encashment settings, allowing them to understand the impact of their configuration changes.
- Multiple calculation options are available (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days) providing flexibility but requiring careful selection
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist for one or multiple employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions before saving new salary proration configuration changes

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and connects with leave management systems to receive approved unpaid leave requests and employee record systems for salary information.
- The Daily Wage Calculator impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It interacts with the company's public holiday calendar configuration and payroll settings.
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service calculations, and Leave Management system to customize leave encashment policies that affect end-of-service benefit calculations.
- Interacts with the payroll system to apply daily calculated deductions to monthly employee pay; similar to leave encashment functionality
- Interacts with Payroll system and Daily Wage Calculator (DWC); affects active payroll table transactions and employee first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations
