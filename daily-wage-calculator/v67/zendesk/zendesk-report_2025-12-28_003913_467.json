    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees who take unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the total working days. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-27\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees who take unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the total working days. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions with multiple calculation base options.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Company public holiday calendar must be configured to properly exclude weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator.

The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used. Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to arrive at actual working days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days, working days, or custom days.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation results vary depending on month length and selected calculation method.
