    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system component that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily rate. The calculator accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working day counts. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the specific leave policy and calendar conditions."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-26\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system component that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily rate. The calculator accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working day counts. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the specific leave policy and calendar conditions.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control and accuracy. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- To adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Primary Personas\n- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave requests and salary calculations. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Superadmin, Payroll table managers, and transaction processors who configure and manage daily wage calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admin users who manage payroll configuration and salary proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Navigation Paths\n- Access the daily wage calculator through the payroll table after approving an unpaid leave request; the system automatically generates pay deductions that are reflected in the payroll table. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation to access the salary proration configuration interface. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Prerequisites\n- An approved unpaid leave request must exist; employee salary information (basic and allowance amounts) must be configured; the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) must be defined for the organization. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to exclude weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admin role is required to access and modify salary proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Required Inputs\n- Employee's total salary amount (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days or calendar days in the month based on leave policy, approved unpaid leave days, and public holidays falling within the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only). [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days to determine how salary proration is calculated. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Expected Outputs\n- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, calculated daily pay rate, and the deduction amount reflected on the payroll table. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method, affecting first salary and end-of-service settlement amounts. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Procedures\n- Receive and approve unpaid leave request; determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days); identify public holidays in the month; calculate actual working days by subtracting public holidays from the total working days; calculate daily pay by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by actual working days; system automatically generates and reflects the pay deduction on the payroll table. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Navigate to Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), choose salary components to include in the calculation, and apply the configuration. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- 1. Go to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. Leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are calendar days (all days in a month), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible configuration per company policy). Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working day count before calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22. The number of days used depends on whether the leave policy follows calendar days or working days methodology. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation varies by month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), and different calculation bases produce different daily wage rates that impact final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are already submitted for employees, Super admin must manually reject existing transactions before saving new salary proration settings to avoid conflicts. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and depends on leave management system for approved leave requests and employee record systems for salary information. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- The Daily Wage Calculator impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It interacts with the company's public holiday calendar and payroll settings to determine accurate daily wage rates. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- The daily wage calculator interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions, including first salary calculations and end-of-service settlements. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Glossary Terms\n- Daily pay: The calculated daily salary rate used to deduct unpaid leave days from an employee's salary.
