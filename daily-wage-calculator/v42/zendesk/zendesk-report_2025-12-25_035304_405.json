    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay rates when employees take unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature automatically generates pay deductions reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. It supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies, with public holidays automatically subtracted from the working day count. This ensures accurate salary deductions aligned with the organization's leave policy framework."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-24\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay rates when employees take unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature automatically generates pay deductions reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. It supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies, with public holidays automatically subtracted from the working day count. This ensures accurate salary deductions aligned with the organization's leave policy framework.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by dividing total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, with automatic pay deductions reflected on the payroll table upon leave approval.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (31 days in January, 28 days in February, etc.). Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in company's public holiday calendar. Custom days allows companies to set a fixed number of days (commonly 30 days for UAE and KSA compliance with labor law requirements). [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration will have an effect on all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving. ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new proration changes. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- When public holidays fall within the calculation month, they must be explicitly subtracted from the working days count. For example, if 2 days are public holidays and the policy is 22 working days, the calculation uses 20 days instead of 22. ; The number of days used in the denominator differs based on leave policy: calendar day policies use fixed calendar days (e.g., 30), while working day policies use the specified working days minus public holidays. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily wage calculations vary based on month length when using calendar days method (e.g., 31 days in January versus 28 days in February), which directly impacts salary proration and leave encashment amounts. Selection of different calculation bases can significantly affect final wage calculations and must align with company policy and regional labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- If the payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then resave the proration settings to apply the new calculation basis. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table upon unpaid leave approval. ; The feature depends on the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and trigger the calculation workflow. ; The feature requires access to employee records to retrieve salary information (basic + allowance) and leave policy details. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, public holiday calendar configuration, salary proration calculations, leave encashment processes, and unpaid leave deduction systems to ensure consistent and accurate wage calculations across all payroll functions. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions, particularly impacting first salary calculations and end-of-service settlements.
