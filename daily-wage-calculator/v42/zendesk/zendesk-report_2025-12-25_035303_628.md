  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-24  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay rates when employees take unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature automatically generates pay deductions reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. It supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies, with public holidays automatically subtracted from the working day count. This ensures accurate salary deductions aligned with the organization's leave policy framework.

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Creation → Payroll Table Reflection — _The workflow triggered when an unpaid leave request is approved, leading to automatic daily pay calculation and deduction._
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point for the Daily Wage Calculator feature where users configure calculation bases and salary components. | Primary navigation path to access salary proration configuration in the Daily Wage Calculator_

### Prerequisites

- Unpaid leave request must be approved before daily pay calculation and deduction occurs. ; Organization must have a defined leave policy (either calendar days or working days based). ; Employee salary information (basic salary and allowances) must be available in the system.
- Company's public holiday calendar must be configured to accurately exclude weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation base.
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount (Basic + Allowance) ; Number of actual working days or calendar days in the month ; Public holiday dates falling within the calculation month — _The combined basic salary and allowances used as the numerator in the daily pay calculation formula. ; Determined by the organization's leave policy; can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). ; Public holidays are deducted from the working days count to arrive at actual working days for the calculation._
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components selection — _User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (all days in month), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined number of days). ; User must choose which salary components to include in daily wage calculations: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only._
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days to determine how salary proration is calculated_

### Outputs and results

- Calculated daily pay rate ; Automatic pay deduction reflected on payroll table — _The result of dividing total salary by actual working days, used as the deduction amount per unpaid leave day. ; Upon unpaid leave approval, a pay deduction associated with the specific request is automatically created and displayed in the payroll system._
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System generates daily wage rates that are applied to three main areas: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations._
- Updated salary calculations — _Proportionally adjusted employee compensation based on the selected calculation method (custom days, calendar days, or working days), affecting all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** — _When an unpaid leave request is approved and a salary deduction needs to be calculated and applied._
  - Receive and approve the unpaid leave request
  - Identify the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days)
  - Determine the total number of days in the policy (e.g., 30 calendar days or 22 working days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling within the calculation month
  - Subtract public holidays from the working days count to obtain actual working days
  - Obtain the employee's total salary amount (Basic + Allowance)
  - Apply the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount / Actual Working Days
  - Automatically create and reflect the pay deduction on the payroll table
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up or modifying daily wage calculation methodology for payroll processing._
  - Navigate to Settings menu
  - Select Payroll option
  - Click on Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
  - Choose salary components to include in calculation
  - Confirm and apply settings
- **Update Salary Proration** — _When Super admin needs to change how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked_
  - Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation
  - Select the required calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days
  - Save changes
  - If payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted, reject the existing transactions with prorated salaries
  - Save the changes for salary proration again to apply new settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. ; The leave policy determines whether calculations use calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 working days). ; Public holidays falling in the month for which daily pay is being calculated must be deducted from the working days to arrive at actual working days. ; Only approved unpaid leave requests trigger automatic pay deduction creation.
- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (31 days in January, 28 days in February, etc.). Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in company's public holiday calendar. Custom days allows companies to set a fixed number of days (commonly 30 days for UAE and KSA compliance with labor law requirements).
- Changes to salary proration will have an effect on all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving. ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new proration changes.

### Edge cases and warnings

- When public holidays fall within the calculation month, they must be explicitly subtracted from the working days count. For example, if 2 days are public holidays and the policy is 22 working days, the calculation uses 20 days instead of 22. ; The number of days used in the denominator differs based on leave policy: calendar day policies use fixed calendar days (e.g., 30), while working day policies use the specified working days minus public holidays.
- Daily wage calculations vary based on month length when using calendar days method (e.g., 31 days in January versus 28 days in February), which directly impacts salary proration and leave encashment amounts. Selection of different calculation bases can significantly affect final wage calculations and must align with company policy and regional labor law requirements.
- If the payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then resave the proration settings to apply the new calculation basis.

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table upon unpaid leave approval. ; The feature depends on the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and trigger the calculation workflow. ; The feature requires access to employee records to retrieve salary information (basic + allowance) and leave policy details.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, public holiday calendar configuration, salary proration calculations, leave encashment processes, and unpaid leave deduction systems to ensure consistent and accurate wage calculations across all payroll functions.
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions, particularly impacting first salary calculations and end-of-service settlements.
