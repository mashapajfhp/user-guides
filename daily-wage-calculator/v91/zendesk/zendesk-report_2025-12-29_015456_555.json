    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control over calculation methodology.

[Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Super admin users who manage payroll configuration and salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Navigation Paths\n- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation.

The leave policy determines whether calculation is based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to determine actual working days for the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days, working days, or custom days. Working days exclude weekends and public holidays. Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with labor law requirements. Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February). [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component selection limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days.

[Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay. Configuration is performed when adding a new leave policy. [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days total when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation must use 20 days instead of 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Monthly day counts vary by calendar month, affecting daily wage calculations. Different calculation bases (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) produce different daily wage rates and impact final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins should be aware that configuring leave encashment policies may overwrite existing eligible paid leave-type policies, and visibility is provided to identify which policies will be affected. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days), requiring careful selection based on organizational policy. [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and integrates with leave management systems to process approved unpaid leave requests and employee records.
