  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.

### Navigation paths

- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation.
- Access the Daily Wage Calculator by navigating to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure.
- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Selecting Unpaid leave option.
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee before daily pay deduction can be calculated and applied.
- Company public holiday calendar must be configured to exclude weekends and public holidays from working days calculations.
- Super admin role required to access and configure leave encashment settings.
- Access to Leave Settings and ability to add or modify leave policies as a Super Admin.
- Super admin access to payroll settings; existing payroll system with employee records

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days in the month, number of calendar days in the month (if using calendar day policy), public holidays falling in the month, and approved unpaid leave days.
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and choice of salary components to include (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days) when configuring unpaid leave deduction settings.
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, reflected on the payroll table, and calculated daily pay rate used to determine the deduction amount.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and determines which salary components and calculation methods apply to leave encashment.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation that applies daily deductions to the employee's monthly payroll.
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active unpaid amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days to arrive at actual working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary amount by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to factor into calculations.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days).
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days. The leave policy determines whether calculation is based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to determine actual working days for the calculation.
- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days, working days, or custom days. Working days exclude weekends and public holidays. Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with labor law requirements. Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February).
- Salary component selection limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten by the configuration.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay. Configuration is performed when adding a new leave policy.
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days total when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation must use 20 days instead of 22 days.
- Monthly day counts vary by calendar month, affecting daily wage calculations. Different calculation bases (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) produce different daily wage rates and impact final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts.
- Super admins should be aware that configuring leave encashment policies may overwrite existing eligible paid leave-type policies, and visibility is provided to identify which policies will be affected.
- Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days), requiring careful selection based on organizational policy.
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and integrates with leave management systems to process approved unpaid leave requests and employee records.
- The Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It integrates with the company's public holiday calendar and payroll settings.
- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service calculations, and Leave Management system to customize leave encashment policies that affect end-of-service leave calculations.
- Interacts with the payroll system by calculating daily deductions that are applied to monthly employee pay; similar to leave encashment functionality.
- Interacts with Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions; impacts first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations
