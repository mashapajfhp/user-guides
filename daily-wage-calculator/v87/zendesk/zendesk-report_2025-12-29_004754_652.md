  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working day count, and supports both calendar day and working day leave policies. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary adjustments based on the employee's leave policy and the specific month's working days.

- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator settings
- Access to Leave Settings and ability to add or modify leave policies as a Super Admin.
- Super admin access to payroll settings; payroll system must be configured

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days in the month, leave policy type (calendar days or working days), and approved unpaid leave days.
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to include in calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), selection of calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and configuration of eligible leave types for encashment

- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation that applies daily deductions to be set off against the employee's monthly pay.
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on the selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) payroll amounts

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select a calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose salary components to factor into calculations.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days).
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation.
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days for UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). The selected calculation base directly impacts salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts.
- Salary component selection limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method options are Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Configuration applies to eligible paid leave types for end-of-service encashment.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay. Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only, Basic + Allowances) with multiple day calculation type options (calendar days, working days, custom days).
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted, Super admin must reject existing transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the total working days when calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22 days.
- Calendar day calculations vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage rates. Different calculation bases produce different daily wage values, so selection must align with company policy and applicable labor laws.
- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when applying new leave encashment configurations
- Multiple options exist for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, requiring careful selection based on organizational payroll policies.
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist for one or multiple employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions before saving new salary proration changes to ensure proper application of the new calculation basis.

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions, and connects with leave management systems to process approved unpaid leave requests and employee record systems.
- The Daily Wage Calculator impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It integrates with the company's public holiday calendar and payroll settings to ensure accurate calculations.
- Interacts with Payroll settings, End of Service calculations, and Leave Management system to customize leave encashment policies that affect end-of-service calculations
- Interacts with the payroll system by calculating daily deductions that are applied to monthly employee pay; similar to leave encashment functionality.
- Interacts with the Payroll system and payroll table; affects active payroll transactions and employee compensation calculations
