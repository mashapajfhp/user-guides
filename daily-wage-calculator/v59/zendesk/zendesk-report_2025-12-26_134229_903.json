    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily rate. The system accounts for leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working day counts. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the calculator generates an automatic pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the employee's leave policy and the specific month's working day configuration."
