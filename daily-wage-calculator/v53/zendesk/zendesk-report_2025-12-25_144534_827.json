    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay rates for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays and leave policy type (calendar or working days). Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary reductions based on the organization's leave policy and statutory holidays. It streamlines payroll administration by automating calculations that would otherwise require manual computation."

The article confirms that upon approval of an unpaid leave request, an automatic pay deduction is created and reflected on the payroll table."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay rates for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays and leave policy type (calendar or working days). Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary reductions based on the organization's leave policy and statutory holidays. It streamlines payroll administration by automating calculations that would otherwise require manual computation.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays.

The number of days is determined by the leave policy (calendar days or working days). ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to calculate actual working days for the daily pay calculation. ; Only approved unpaid leave requests trigger automatic pay deduction creation; unapproved requests do not generate deductions. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February). ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Custom days allows organizations to set a fixed number of calculation days; most UAE and KSA companies use 30 days to comply with regional labor laws that define a month as 30 days. ; Only Superadmins, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select and modify the calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving changes to salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- When public holidays occur within the month, they must be explicitly subtracted from the working days count. For example, if 2 public holidays occur in a 22-day working month, daily pay is calculated on 20 days, not 22 days. ; The leave policy type (calendar days vs. working days) significantly impacts the daily pay calculation; using the wrong policy type will result in incorrect deductions. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Monthly day count variation: Calendar days calculation will produce different daily wage rates for months with different day counts (31, 30, 28, or 29 days), which directly impacts salary proration and leave encashment amounts. ; Public holiday impact: Working days calculation depends on accurate public holiday calendar configuration; missing or incorrect public holidays will result in incorrect daily wage calculations. ; Calculation method impact: Different calculation bases (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) will produce significantly different daily wage rates and affect final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- Depends on leave management system to receive and process unpaid leave requests; integrates with payroll system to automatically create and reflect deductions on the payroll table. ; Relies on employee record system to retrieve salary information (basic salary and allowances) for calculation. ; Requires access to calendar/holiday management system to identify public holidays for the calculation month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three payroll areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction; changes to calculation settings affect all three areas simultaneously. ; Feature depends on company's public holiday calendar configuration for accurate working days calculation. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions; salary proration impacts both first salary calculations and end-of-service settlement amounts [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Glossary Terms\n- Daily Pay ; Actual Working Days ; Unpaid Leave ; Pay Deduction: The calculated per-day salary amount derived by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, used to determine the deduction amount for each unpaid leave day. ; The number of working days in a month after deducting public holidays; used as the denominator in the daily pay calculation formula. ; A leave type for which employees do not receive salary; the daily wage calculator computes the salary deduction for each unpaid leave day taken. ; An automatic salary reduction created and reflected on the payroll table upon approval of an unpaid leave request, calculated using the daily pay rate.
