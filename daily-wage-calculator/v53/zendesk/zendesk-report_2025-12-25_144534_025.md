  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-25  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay rates for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays and leave policy type (calendar or working days). Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction reflected on the payroll table. This feature ensures accurate and consistent salary reductions based on the organization's leave policy and statutory holidays. It streamlines payroll administration by automating calculations that would otherwise require manual computation.

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Generation → Payroll Table Reflection — _The workflow triggered when an unpaid leave request is approved, leading to automatic deduction creation and payroll visibility._
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point for configuring the Daily Wage Calculator and selecting calculation bases and salary components. | Primary navigation to access salary proration configuration within the Daily Wage Calculator_

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist before daily pay deduction can be calculated and applied.
- User must have Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator. ; Company's public holiday calendar must be configured to accurately exclude public holidays when using working days calculation base.
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount ; Number of actual working days in the month ; Leave policy type designation ; Public holidays occurring in the calculation month — _Combination of basic salary and allowances; used as numerator in daily pay calculation formula. ; Determined by leave policy type (calendar days such as 30 days, or working days such as 22 days); public holidays are subtracted from this figure. ; Specifies whether the organization uses calendar days or working days as the basis for leave calculation. ; Public holiday dates must be identified and deducted from the working days count to arrive at actual working days._
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components selection — _User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (total days in the month), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (user-defined number of days, commonly 30 for UAE and KSA compliance). ; User must choose which salary components to include in daily wage calculations: basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only._
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days_

### Outputs and results

- Calculated daily pay rate ; Automatic pay deduction entry — _The result of dividing total salary (basic + allowance) by actual working days, used as the deduction amount per unpaid leave day. ; A deduction record automatically created and associated with the specific unpaid leave request, reflected on the payroll table._
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System generates daily wage rates that are applied to three areas: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations. The output varies based on selected calculation base and salary components._
- Updated salary calculations — _Proportionally adjusted employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave** — _When an unpaid leave request has been approved and a salary deduction must be calculated and applied to payroll._
  - Receive and approve the unpaid leave request
  - Identify the leave policy type (calendar days or working days)
  - Determine the total number of days in the policy (e.g., 30 calendar days or 22 working days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling in the month of the unpaid leave
  - Subtract public holidays from the total working days to calculate actual working days
  - Obtain the employee's total salary amount (basic salary plus allowances)
  - Apply the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Actual Working Days
  - The system automatically creates and reflects the pay deduction on the payroll table
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up or modifying how the organization calculates daily wages for payroll purposes._
  - Navigate to Settings menu
  - Select Payroll option
  - Choose Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days
  - Choose salary components to include: basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only
  - Apply configuration to impact salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations
- **Update Salary Proration** — _When adjusting how employee salaries are calculated based on days worked, particularly for first salaries and end-of-service settlements_
  - Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation
  - Select calculation basis from available options: custom days, calendar days, or working days
  - Make necessary changes according to required calculation bases
  - Save changes
  - If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions before saving new proration settings
  - Confirm new proration settings are applied

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. The number of days is determined by the leave policy (calendar days or working days). ; Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to calculate actual working days for the daily pay calculation. ; Only approved unpaid leave requests trigger automatic pay deduction creation; unapproved requests do not generate deductions.
- Calendar days calculation uses the actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February). ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Custom days allows organizations to set a fixed number of calculation days; most UAE and KSA companies use 30 days to comply with regional labor laws that define a month as 30 days. ; Only Superadmins, Payroll table managers, or transaction processors can select and modify the calculation base.
- Changes to salary proration will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving changes to salary proration settings

### Edge cases and warnings

- When public holidays occur within the month, they must be explicitly subtracted from the working days count. For example, if 2 public holidays occur in a 22-day working month, daily pay is calculated on 20 days, not 22 days. ; The leave policy type (calendar days vs. working days) significantly impacts the daily pay calculation; using the wrong policy type will result in incorrect deductions.
- Monthly day count variation: Calendar days calculation will produce different daily wage rates for months with different day counts (31, 30, 28, or 29 days), which directly impacts salary proration and leave encashment amounts. ; Public holiday impact: Working days calculation depends on accurate public holiday calendar configuration; missing or incorrect public holidays will result in incorrect daily wage calculations. ; Calculation method impact: Different calculation bases (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) will produce significantly different daily wage rates and affect final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts.
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Depends on leave management system to receive and process unpaid leave requests; integrates with payroll system to automatically create and reflect deductions on the payroll table. ; Relies on employee record system to retrieve salary information (basic salary and allowances) for calculation. ; Requires access to calendar/holiday management system to identify public holidays for the calculation month.
- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three payroll areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction; changes to calculation settings affect all three areas simultaneously. ; Feature depends on company's public holiday calendar configuration for accurate working days calculation.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions; salary proration impacts both first salary calculations and end-of-service settlement amounts
