  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-25  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay rates for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature generates automatic pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the organization's leave policy (working days or calendar days). The calculator is essential for maintaining payroll accuracy and compliance with leave management policies.

## Knowledge Extract

### Job to be done

- Calculate and automatically deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays.
- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control than previously available.
- To adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement by selecting appropriate calculation bases (custom days, calendar days, or working days).

### Primary personas

- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave requests, approving unpaid leave, and processing salary calculations and payroll deductions.
- Superadmin, Payroll table managers, and transaction processors who configure and manage daily wage calculation settings.
- Super admin

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Creation → Payroll Table Reflection — _The workflow for processing unpaid leave and generating corresponding daily pay deductions in the payroll system._
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point to configure daily wage calculator settings and calculation bases. | Primary navigation to access Daily Wage Calculator configuration interface_

### Prerequisites

- An unpaid leave request must be submitted and approved before daily pay calculation and deduction can be initiated. ; The organization must have a defined leave policy specifying whether calculations are based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days).
- User must have Superadmin, Payroll table manager, or transaction processor role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator. ; Company must have a configured public holiday calendar to use working days calculation base accurately.
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount ; Number of actual working days or calendar days in the month ; Public holidays falling within the calculation month — _Comprises basic salary plus allowances; used as the numerator in the daily pay calculation formula. ; Determined by the organization's leave policy; serves as the denominator in the daily pay calculation formula. ; Public holidays must be identified and deducted from the working days total to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation._
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components to include — _User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (total days in month), working days (business days excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined number of days per month). ; User must choose which salary components to factor into calculations: basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only._
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days to determine how salary proration is calculated_

### Outputs and results

- Calculated daily pay rate ; Automatic pay deduction reflected on payroll table — _The result of dividing salary amount (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days; used as the basis for unpaid leave deductions. ; Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, a pay deduction associated with the specific request is automatically created and displayed on the payroll table._
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System generates daily wage rates used for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations based on selected calculation base and salary components._
- Updated salary calculations with proportional adjustment — _System recalculates employee compensation based on selected calculation method and applies changes to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** — _When an unpaid leave request is approved and a corresponding salary deduction must be calculated and applied to the employee's payroll._
  - Receive and approve the unpaid leave request
  - Identify the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days)
  - Determine the total number of days in the policy (e.g., 30 calendar days or 22 working days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling within the calculation month
  - Deduct public holidays from the total working days to calculate actual working days
  - Retrieve the employee's total salary amount (basic + allowance)
  - Apply the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Actual Working Days
  - Automatically generate and reflect the pay deduction on the payroll table
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up or modifying how daily wages are calculated for payroll processing, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions._
  - Navigate to Settings menu
  - Select Payroll option
  - Choose Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days
  - Choose salary components to include: basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only
  - Apply configuration
- **Update Salary Proration Settings** — _When Super admin needs to change how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked (applicable for new hires or departing employees)_
  - Navigate to Settings menu
  - Select Payroll option
  - Choose Daily wage calculation
  - Select calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days
  - Save changes
  - If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions before saving new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of Actual Working Days in the Month. ; The number of days used in the calculation depends on the organization's leave policy: either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). ; Public holidays falling within the month must be deducted from the working days total to determine the actual working days used in the daily pay calculation. ; Daily pay calculations are only performed upon approval of an unpaid leave request; the deduction is automatically created and reflected on the payroll table.
- Calculation base options are limited to three types: calendar days (actual days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined). ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days as the calculation base to align with regional labor law requirements. ; Salary component selection is limited to three options: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only.
- Changes to salary proration will immediately affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the existing transactions before saving new salary proration changes.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days total; failure to account for public holidays will result in incorrect daily pay calculations. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a 22-working-day month, the calculation must use 20 days, not 22 days. ; The leave policy type (calendar days vs. working days) significantly impacts the daily pay calculation and must be correctly identified before performing the calculation.
- Calendar days calculation varies by month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which impacts daily wage calculations and resulting proration amounts. ; Different calculation bases (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) produce different daily wage rates and can significantly impact final wage calculations for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then save the changes for salary proration to take effect.

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator integrates with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The feature depends on employee records to retrieve salary information (basic + allowance) and on the organization's leave policy configuration to determine the calculation basis (calendar or working days).
- Daily Wage Calculator impacts three main payroll areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction calculations. ; Feature depends on company's public holiday calendar configuration to accurately calculate working days when that calculation base is selected.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly impacts active payroll table transactions, first salary calculations, and end-of-service settlement amounts.
