    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay rates for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature generates automatic pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the organization's leave policy (working days or calendar days). The calculator is essential for maintaining payroll accuracy and compliance with leave management policies."

It explains that daily pay is derived by dividing the total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The article clarifies that organizations may follow either a calendar days policy (e.g., 30 days) or a working days policy (e.g., 22 days), and that public holidays must be deducted from the working days total to determine actual working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, an automatic pay deduction is created and reflected on the payroll table."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay rates for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowances) by the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature generates automatic pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the organization's leave policy (working days or calendar days). The calculator is essential for maintaining payroll accuracy and compliance with leave management policies.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and automatically deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays.

[Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are limited to three types: calendar days (actual days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined). ; Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays as defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days as the calculation base to align with regional labor law requirements. ; Salary component selection is limited to three options: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration will immediately affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the existing transactions before saving new salary proration changes. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days total; failure to account for public holidays will result in incorrect daily pay calculations. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a 22-working-day month, the calculation must use 20 days, not 22 days. ; The leave policy type (calendar days vs. working days) significantly impacts the daily pay calculation and must be correctly identified before performing the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation varies by month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which impacts daily wage calculations and resulting proration amounts. ; Different calculation bases (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) produce different daily wage rates and can significantly impact final wage calculations for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then save the changes for salary proration to take effect. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator integrates with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The feature depends on employee records to retrieve salary information (basic + allowance) and on the organization's leave policy configuration to determine the calculation basis (calendar or working days). [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator impacts three main payroll areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction calculations. ; Feature depends on company's public holiday calendar configuration to accurately calculate working days when that calculation base is selected. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with the Payroll system and directly impacts active payroll table transactions, first salary calculations, and end-of-service settlement amounts.
