    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay rates for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working or calendar days in the month. The feature accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the working days count before calculating the daily rate. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days)."

The article includes a worked example showing how 2 public holidays reduce the calculation basis from 22 working days to 20 days."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\n  Generated on: 2025-12-24\n\n  ## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\n  The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes and deducts daily pay rates for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working or calendar days in the month. The feature accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the working days count before calculating the daily rate. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate salary reductions based on the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days).\n\n  ## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n  - Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of actual working or calendar days in the month, accounting for public holidays. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts, replacing previous limited calculation options.

Automatic pay deduction ; Payroll table reflection | details: Daily pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month ; A pay deduction associated with the specific unpaid leave request is automatically created upon approval ; The automatic pay deduction is reflected on the payroll table for the relevant pay period | [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculated daily wage rates | details: System generates daily wage rates used for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations based on selected calculation base and salary components. | [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Updated salary calculations | details: System applies proportionally adjusted employee compensation based on selected calculation method to all active (unpaid) payroll transactions | [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n  ## Procedures\n  - **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave** | when_to_use: When an employee's unpaid leave request has been approved and salary deduction needs to be calculated | steps: Receive and approve the unpaid leave request → Determine the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days) → Identify the total number of days according to the policy (e.g., 22 working days or 30 calendar days) → Identify all public holidays falling in the calculation month → Subtract public holidays from the total working days to arrive at actual working days → Retrieve the employee's total salary (Basic + Allowance) → Calculate daily pay by dividing salary amount by actual working days → The system automatically generates a pay deduction and reflects it on the payroll table | [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** | when_to_use: When setting up or modifying daily wage calculation methodology for the organization. | steps: Navigate to Settings menu → Select Payroll option → Choose Daily Wage Calculation → Select calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days → Choose salary components to include in calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only) → Save configuration | [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- **Update Salary Proration** | when_to_use: When Super admin needs to change how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked (e.g., first salary, end-of-service settlement) | steps: Navigate to Settings menu → Select Payroll section → Choose Daily wage calculation option → Select desired calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days → Save changes → If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions: reject those transactions and resave the new proration settings | [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n  ## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n  - Daily pay formula: Daily pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month ; The number of days used in calculation can be either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if following the calendar days leave policy, or working days (e.g., 22 working days) if following the working days leave policy ; Public holidays falling in the month for which daily pay is being calculated must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days ; Pay deductions are only created and reflected on the payroll table upon approval of the unpaid leave request [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are limited to three types: calendar days (actual days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined fixed number). ; When using working days calculation base, the system automatically excludes weekends and public holidays defined in the company's public holiday calendar. ; Most companies in UAE and KSA use custom days set to 30 to comply with local labor law requirements that define a month as 30 days. ; Salary component selection is limited to three options: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n  ## Edge Cases & Warnings\n  - Public holidays must be carefully tracked and subtracted from working days. For example, if December 2nd and 3rd are National Day holidays and the leave policy uses 22 working days, the calculation must use 20 days (22 - 2 public holidays) instead of 22 days ; The calculation methodology differs based on leave policy type: calendar days policies use fixed day counts (e.g., 30 days) while working days policies exclude weekends and must further exclude public holidays [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation will vary by month: January has 31 days, February has 28 days (or 29 in leap years), creating month-to-month variation in calculated daily wages if calendar days base is used. ; Different calculation bases (calendar days vs. working days vs. custom days) will produce different daily wage amounts for the same employee, directly impacting salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions already submitted, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions after changing proration settings to ensure consistency [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n  ## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n  - The daily wage calculator is triggered by and depends on the unpaid leave request approval workflow in the leave management system ; The feature integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table ; The feature depends on employee records to retrieve salary information (Basic + Allowance components) ; The feature depends on the system's calendar configuration to identify and account for public holidays [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator directly impacts three payroll processes: salary proration (distributing salary across partial months), leave encashment (calculating monetary value of accrued leave), and unpaid leave deduction (calculating deductions for unpaid leave taken). ; Working days calculation base depends on the company's public holiday calendar configuration to accurately exclude public holidays from daily wage calculations.
