  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-29  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a system component that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculator accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the working day count, and supports both calendar day-based (e.g., 30 days) and working day-based (e.g., 22 days) leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate and consistent salary calculations across the organization.

- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes applied to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Process unpaid leave: receive unpaid leave request, approve leave request, determine leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days to arrive at actual working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary amount by actual working days, and generate automatic payroll deduction
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select a calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose salary components to factor into calculations.
- Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure; select applicable salary components for leave encashment; choose calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days); configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days).
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days; the leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days); public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to determine actual working days used in the calculation
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month, e.g., 31 in January, 28 in February), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible, commonly set to 30 in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law).
- Salary component selection limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances; calculation method options are calendar days, working days, or custom days; configuration applies to individual leave types for end-of-service eligibility.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay. Configuration options are limited to Basic Only, Basic + Allowances for calculation methods, and Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days for day calculation types.
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working day count when calculating daily pay; for example, if 2 days are public holidays in a 22-day working month, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days
- Calculation varies depending on month length and selected calculation method; different calculation bases can significantly impact final wage calculations, particularly for salary proration and leave encashment.
- Super admins can view which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when applying new leave encashment configurations.
- Multiple options exist for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, requiring Super Admins to select the appropriate method based on organizational policy.
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings
