    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a system component that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculator accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the working day count, and supports both calendar day-based (e.g., 30 days) and working day-based (e.g., 22 days) leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate and consistent salary calculations across the organization."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-29\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a system component that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculator accounts for public holidays by subtracting them from the working day count, and supports both calendar day-based (e.g., 30 days) and working day-based (e.g., 22 days) leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. This ensures accurate and consistent salary calculations across the organization.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, with options to select calculation bases and salary components.
