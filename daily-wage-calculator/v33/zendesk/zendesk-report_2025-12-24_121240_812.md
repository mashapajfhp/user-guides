  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-24  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll system component that automatically computes and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing an employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month. The feature supports two leave policy models: calendar days (e.g., 30 days) and working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling within the calculation month are automatically deducted from the working days count to arrive at the actual working days figure. When an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction that is reflected on the payroll table. The feature ensures consistent and accurate salary calculations across the organization by applying standardized daily pay formulas. It integrates with leave management and employee record systems to process deductions seamlessly. The calculator eliminates manual computation errors and ensures compliance with the organization's leave and payroll policies. The daily wage calculator (DWC) is a payroll feature that enables Super admins to adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked. This feature affects critical payroll calculations including an employee's first salary and end-of-service settlement amounts. The daily wage calculator supports multiple calculation bases—custom days, calendar days, or working days—allowing organizations to align salary proration with their specific operational requirements. When Super admins update salary proration settings through the Daily Wage Calculation interface, the changes are applied to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table, ensuring consistency across payroll records. The feature is designed to ensure accurate compensation when employees have incomplete work periods, such as during onboarding or separation. By providing flexible calculation methodologies, the daily wage calculator accommodates diverse payroll policies and regulatory requirements across different organizational contexts.

  - Navigate to Settings menu
  - Select Payroll option
  - Choose Daily wage calculation

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month
- Leave policy can be based on either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days)
- Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days
- Pay deduction is only created and reflected automatically upon approval of an unpaid leave request

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from working days; failure to do so will result in incorrect daily pay calculations
- The calculation method differs based on leave policy type (calendar days vs. working days); ensure the correct policy type is applied for the employee
- If public holidays are not properly accounted for, the actual working days count will be incorrect, leading to overstated or understated daily pay rates
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings
- Salary proration changes impact both first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations, requiring careful review before implementation
