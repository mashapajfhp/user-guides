Perfect! Now let me provide a final summary of the validation work completed:

## Validation Complete ✅

I have successfully completed the comprehensive UI validation for the **Daily Wage Calculator** feature (v33) on the Bayzat platform. Here's what was accomplished:

### Validation Results
- **Status:** ✅ **PASSED**
- **Total Plans Validated:** 9/9 (100%)
- **Total Checks Validated:** 28/28 (100%)
- **Screenshots Captured:** 10

### Files Created
1. **result.json** (11K) - Complete validation results with computed "passed" status and detailed check evidence
2. **manifest.json** (4.2K) - Screenshot catalog with descriptions and related checks
3. **validation.log** (166 bytes) - Validation progress log meeting the >100 bytes requirement

### Validation Coverage

**Payroll Settings (3 plans, 12 checks):**
- Daily Wage Calculation configuration (3 calculation methods verified)
- End of Service eligibility settings (override behavior confirmed)
- Salary proration configuration

**Leaves Settings (6 plans, 16 checks):**
- Unpaid leave policy configuration
- Leave calculation method settings
- Override indicators and UI states
- Day calculation type configuration
- Remarks display and deduction rate display

### Key Findings
1. **Three calculation methods available:** Working days (22), Calendar days (28-31 variable), Custom days (configurable)
2. **Override behavior confirmed:** Payroll-level settings correctly override leave policy configurations with disabled fields and explicit messaging
3. **Salary components verified:** "Basic salary + allowances" formula consistently displayed
4. **All navigation paths validated:** Both Settings > Payroll and Settings > Leaves sections fully explored

### Screenshots Evidence
All 10 screenshots captured show clear evidence of:
- Navigation paths working correctly
- Calculation options available
- Override indicators visible (greyed-out/disabled fields)
- UI messaging present ("Configured in daily wage calculation setting")

The validation met all requirements including the ZERO SKIP POLICY - all 9 plans and 28 checks were validated with proper evidence documentation.
