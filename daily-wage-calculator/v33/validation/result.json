  "summary": "All 19 claims validated successfully. Daily wage calculator feature demonstrates consistent logic across calculation rules (formula, holiday deduction, policy-based day calculation), system behaviors (automatic deduction creation, payroll reflection, configuration impact), navigation paths (Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation), UI elements (three calculation bases, save action), and permissions (Super admin access control). Mathematical examples verify calculation accuracy. Workflow from unpaid leave approval to payroll deduction is logically sound. Configuration management properly handles active transactions and requires appropriate permissions."
