    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total, and supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction reflected on the payroll table."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total, and supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction reflected on the payroll table.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions with options to select calculation bases and salary components.

[Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. Leave policy determines whether calculation uses calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation. The deduction is automatically created upon approval of the unpaid leave request [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Different calculation methods directly impact final wage calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances; calculation method options are calendar days, working days, or custom days; super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated daily and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins must choose from predefined calculation methods and day calculation types [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- When public holidays fall within the month, they must be subtracted from the total working days before calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation varies depending on month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February for calendar days). Selection of different calculation bases and salary components can significantly impact final wage amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins should be aware that configuring leave encashment policies will overwrite existing eligible paid leave-type policies, and the system provides visibility into which policies will be affected [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Multiple calculation options are available (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days) must be selected during configuration [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings; failure to do so may result in inconsistent salary calculations. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- Integrates with leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests; connects with payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions; depends on employee records system for salary information and leave policy configuration [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- The Daily Wage Calculator impacts three main areas: Salary proration, Leave encashment, and Unpaid leave deduction. It interacts with the company's public holiday calendar and payroll settings. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- The Daily Wage Calculator interacts with payroll settings, end-of-service calculations, and leave management systems to customize leave encashment policies [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Interacts with the payroll system to apply daily calculated deductions to monthly employee pay; related to Leave Policies and Leave Settings configuration [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Interacts with Payroll system, Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) module, and affects active payroll table transactions and employee settlement calculations [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Glossary Terms\n- Daily pay: The calculated daily salary rate used to deduct unpaid leave days from an employee's salary.
