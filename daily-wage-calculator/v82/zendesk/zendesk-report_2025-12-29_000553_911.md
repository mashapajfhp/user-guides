  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total, and supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a corresponding pay deduction reflected on the payroll table.

- Calculate and manage unpaid leave deductions on a daily basis to be set off against the employee's monthly pay
- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement

### Primary personas

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation.
- Access the Daily Wage Calculator via Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure
- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee; the employee's salary information (basic and allowance components) must be configured in the system
- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to exclude weekends and public holidays when using working days calculation base.
- User must have super admin role to access and configure leave encashment settings
- Access to Leave Settings configuration as a Super Admin
- Super admin access to payroll settings; existing payroll system with employee salary data

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days in the month, number of calendar days (if using calendar day policy), public holidays falling in the month, approved unpaid leave days
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Salary components selection (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment configuration
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, calculated daily pay rate, deduction reflected on the payroll table
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and visibility of which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation settings that apply daily deductions to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Approve unpaid leave request; determine applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days); identify public holidays in the month; calculate actual working days by subtracting public holidays from total working days; calculate daily pay by dividing salary amount by actual working days; system automatically creates and reflects pay deduction on payroll table
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select a calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure; 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances); 3. Choose calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days); 4. Configure individual leave types for end-of-service calculations
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. Leave policy determines whether calculation uses calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days used in the calculation. The deduction is automatically created upon approval of the unpaid leave request
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined, commonly 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Different calculation methods directly impact final wage calculations.
- Salary component options are limited to Basic Only or Basic + Allowances; calculation method options are calendar days, working days, or custom days; super admins can see which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated daily and set off against the employee's monthly pay; Super Admins must choose from predefined calculation methods and day calculation types
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- When public holidays fall within the month, they must be subtracted from the total working days before calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days
- Calculation varies depending on month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February for calendar days). Selection of different calculation bases and salary components can significantly impact final wage amounts.
- Super admins should be aware that configuring leave encashment policies will overwrite existing eligible paid leave-type policies, and the system provides visibility into which policies will be affected
- Multiple calculation options are available (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days) must be selected during configuration
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings; failure to do so may result in inconsistent salary calculations.
