## Knowledge Extract

### Job to be done

- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days
- Automatically generate pay deductions upon approval of unpaid leave requests and reflect them on the payroll table
- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked

- Payroll administrators responsible for salary calculations and processing payroll deductions
- Super admin

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Automatic Pay Deduction Creation → Payroll Table Reflection — _Standard workflow for processing unpaid leave and calculating daily pay deductions_
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary navigation path to access daily wage calculator configuration_

### Prerequisites

- Unpaid leave request must be approved before pay deduction is created
- Organization must have a defined leave policy (either calendar days or working days based)
- Employee salary information (basic salary and allowances) must be available in the system
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings
- Access to Settings menu and Payroll section

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount — _Calculated as Basic Salary + Allowances; used as the numerator in the daily pay calculation_
- Number of actual working days in the month — _Determined by the leave policy (calendar days or working days) and adjusted for public holidays_
- Public holidays in the calculation month — _Used to adjust the actual working days count by subtracting holiday days from the total working days_
- Leave policy type — _Specifies whether calculations use calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 working days)_
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days_

### Outputs and results

- Calculated daily pay rate — _Derived from the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month_
- Automatic pay deduction — _Associated with the specific unpaid leave request and created upon approval_
- Payroll table reflection — _The pay deduction is automatically reflected in the payroll table for processing_
- Updated salary calculations — _Proportionally adjusted employee compensation based on the selected calculation method (custom days, calendar days, or working days)_
- Modified payroll table entries — _Changes affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave** — _When an employee's unpaid leave request is approved and a salary deduction needs to be calculated_
  - Receive and approve the unpaid leave request
  - Determine the leave policy type (calendar days or working days)
  - Identify the total working days in the month according to the leave policy
  - Identify all public holidays falling in the calculation month
  - Subtract public holidays from the total working days to get actual working days
  - Obtain the employee's total salary (Basic Salary + Allowances)
  - Apply the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount / Actual Working Days
  - System automatically creates the pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request
  - Verify the pay deduction is reflected in the payroll table
- **Update Salary Proration** — _When Super admin needs to change how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked_
  - Navigate to Settings menu
  - Select Payroll section
  - Choose Daily wage calculation option
  - Select the required calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days)
  - Save the changes
  - If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions
  - Resave the new proration settings to confirm

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (Basic + Allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month
- The leave policy can be either calendar-days-based (e.g., 30 days) or working-days-based (e.g., 22 working days)
- Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days to arrive at the actual working days used in the calculation
- Pay deductions are only created and reflected upon approval of the unpaid leave request
- Changes to salary proration will have an effect on all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings
- Salary proration settings are configured at the system level and apply to affected employee records

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from working days; failure to do so will result in incorrect daily pay calculations
- When using calendar-days-based leave policies, ensure the correct number of calendar days (e.g., 30) is used as the baseline before subtracting public holidays
- When using working-days-based leave policies, ensure public holidays are subtracted from the working days count (e.g., 22 days - public holidays = actual working days)
- When payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, Super admin must manually reject those transactions and then resave the new proration settings to ensure the changes take effect correctly
- Changing salary proration affects the employee's first salary and end-of-service settlement, requiring careful consideration before implementation

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Depends on the leave management system to receive and process unpaid leave requests
- Integrates with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions in the payroll table
- Relies on employee records system to retrieve salary information (basic salary and allowances)
- Depends on calendar/holiday management system to identify public holidays for adjustment of working days
- Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) interacts with the Payroll system to compute prorated salaries
- Changes to daily wage calculation settings affect the payroll table and all active (unpaid) payroll amounts
- Salary proration impacts end-of-service settlement calculations

## Glossary

- **Daily Pay**: The amount calculated by dividing an employee's total salary (Basic + Allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, used to determine the deduction for unpaid leave
- **Actual Working Days**: The number of working days in a month after deducting public holidays; used as the denominator in the daily pay calculation
- **Unpaid Leave**: Leave taken by an employee without pay; triggers automatic pay deduction calculation based on daily pay
- **Leave Policy**: The organizational policy defining whether leave is calculated based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 working days)
- **Public Holidays**: Days designated as holidays (e.g., National Day) that must be deducted from working days when calculating actual working days for daily pay computation
- **Salary Proration**: The process of adjusting an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement
- **Daily Wage Calculator (DWC)**: A payroll feature accessible via Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation where Super admins can change how salary is prorated by selecting calculation bases such as custom days, calendar days, or working days
- **Calculation Bases**: Options for determining how salary proration is calculated: custom days, calendar days, or working days
- **Active (Unpaid) Amounts**: Payroll transactions in the payroll table that have not yet been paid and are affected by changes to salary proration settings
