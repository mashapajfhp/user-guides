## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature integrates with the leave management system to generate automatic pay deductions reflected on the payroll table. It supports both calendar day and working day leave policies, ensuring accurate salary calculations based on the organization's leave policy. This feature ensures consistent and compliant payroll processing for unpaid leave scenarios.

- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary access point to the Daily Wage Calculator feature. | Primary navigation path to access salary proration configuration and update calculation bases._

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee before daily pay calculation and deduction can be initiated. ; The organization must have a defined leave policy (either calendar days or working days) configured in the system. ; Public holiday calendar must be configured and up-to-date for the calculation period.
- Company public holiday calendar must be configured to exclude weekends and public holidays from working days calculations.
- User must have Super admin role to access and modify salary proration settings.

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount ; Number of actual working days in the month ; Public holiday dates for the calculation period ; Approved unpaid leave request details — _Comprises Basic salary plus Allowance components used in the daily pay calculation formula. ; Determined by the leave policy (calendar days such as 30 days, or working days such as 22 days) with public holidays deducted from working days. ; Used to adjust the number of actual working days by subtracting public holidays from the total working days in the month. ; Triggers the automatic pay deduction associated with the specific unpaid leave request._
- Calculation base selection ; Salary components to include — _User must select one of three calculation bases: calendar days (total days in a given month), working days (business days only, excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (user-defined number of days per month). ; User must choose which salary components to factor into calculations: basic salary only, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only._
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days to determine how salary proration is calculated._

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table ; Calculated daily pay rate — _Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, a pay deduction is automatically created and displayed in the payroll table for the employee. ; The result of dividing the employee's total salary (Basic + Allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, used to determine the deduction amount for unpaid leave._
- Calculated daily wage rates — _System generates daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations based on selected calculation base and salary components._
- Updated salary calculations — _Changes to salary proration settings result in proportionally adjusted employee compensation based on the selected calculation method, affecting all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table._

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** — _When an unpaid leave request has been approved and a salary deduction needs to be calculated and reflected in payroll._
  - Approve the unpaid leave request
  - Identify the leave policy type (calendar days or working days)
  - Determine the total number of days in the policy (e.g., 30 calendar days or 22 working days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling in the calculation month
  - Subtract public holidays from the total working days to arrive at actual working days
  - Retrieve the employee's total salary amount (Basic + Allowance)
  - Apply the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days
  - The system automatically creates and reflects the pay deduction on the payroll table
- **Configure Daily Wage Calculator** — _When setting up payroll calculations or modifying daily wage calculation methodology to align with company policies or labor law requirements._
  - Navigate to Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation
  - Select calculation base: calendar days, working days, or custom days
  - Choose salary components to include in calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only)
  - Apply configuration to calculate daily wages for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions
- **Update Salary Proration** — _When Super admin needs to change how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked, or when adjusting calculation methodology for payroll processing._
  - Navigate to Settings menu
  - Select Payroll option
  - Choose Daily wage calculation
  - Select calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days
  - Make necessary changes as per required calculation bases
  - Save changes
  - If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject the transactions before saving new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated using the formula: Daily Pay = Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. ; The number of days used in calculation can be either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if following the calendar days leave policy, or working days (e.g., 22 working days) if following the working days leave policy. ; Public holidays falling in the calculation month must be deducted from the working days to determine the actual working days used in the daily pay calculation. ; Pay deduction is automatically created and associated with the specific unpaid leave request upon approval.
- Calendar days calculation uses actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February). Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays configured on the company's public holiday calendar. Custom days allows flexible definition of calculation base according to company policies, with most UAE and KSA companies setting custom days to 30 to comply with regional labor law.
- Changes to salary proration will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving. ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new salary proration changes. ; Salary proration affects both the employee's first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations.

### Edge cases and warnings

- When public holidays fall within the calculation month, they must be explicitly subtracted from the working days. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a 22-day working month, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days. ; The calculation method differs based on leave policy type: calendar day policies use fixed day counts (e.g., 30), while working day policies require adjustment for public holidays.
- Daily wage calculations vary depending on month length when using calendar days (e.g., 31 days in January versus 28 days in February), which impacts final wage calculations. Different calculation bases (calendar days, working days, custom days) can produce significantly different daily wage rates and must be selected carefully to align with company policy and legal requirements.
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions after updating salary proration settings to ensure consistency.

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- The daily wage calculator integrates with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and trigger automatic pay deduction creation. ; The feature interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The feature depends on the public holiday calendar configuration to accurately adjust working days for daily pay calculation. ; The feature relies on employee records system to retrieve salary information (Basic + Allowance) for calculation.
- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, the company's public holiday calendar (required for working days calculations), and impacts three downstream payroll processes: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions, employee first salary calculations, and end-of-service settlements.
