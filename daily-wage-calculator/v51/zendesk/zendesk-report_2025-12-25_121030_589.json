    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature integrates with the leave management system to generate automatic pay deductions reflected on the payroll table. It supports both calendar day and working day leave policies, ensuring accurate salary calculations based on the organization's leave policy. This feature ensures consistent and compliant payroll processing for unpaid leave scenarios."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-25\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically calculates and deducts daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave. It determines the appropriate salary reduction by dividing the employee's total salary (basic + allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for public holidays. The feature integrates with the leave management system to generate automatic pay deductions reflected on the payroll table. It supports both calendar day and working day leave policies, ensuring accurate salary calculations based on the organization's leave policy.

The number of days used in calculation can be either calendar days (e.g., 30 days) if following the calendar days leave policy, or working days (e.g., 22 working days) if following the working days leave policy. ; Public holidays falling in the calculation month must be deducted from the working days to determine the actual working days used in the daily pay calculation. ; Pay deduction is automatically created and associated with the specific unpaid leave request upon approval. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days calculation uses actual number of days in each month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February). Working days calculation excludes weekends and public holidays configured on the company's public holiday calendar. Custom days allows flexible definition of calculation base according to company policies, with most UAE and KSA companies setting custom days to 30 to comply with regional labor law. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table immediately upon saving. ; When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject the transactions with prorated salaries before saving new salary proration changes. ; Salary proration affects both the employee's first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- When public holidays fall within the calculation month, they must be explicitly subtracted from the working days. For example, if 2 days are public holidays in a 22-day working month, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days, not 22 days. ; The calculation method differs based on leave policy type: calendar day policies use fixed day counts (e.g., 30), while working day policies require adjustment for public holidays. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily wage calculations vary depending on month length when using calendar days (e.g., 31 days in January versus 28 days in February), which impacts final wage calculations. Different calculation bases (calendar days, working days, custom days) can produce significantly different daily wage rates and must be selected carefully to align with company policy and legal requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions after updating salary proration settings to ensure consistency. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Feature Interactions / Dependencies\n- The daily wage calculator integrates with the leave management system to receive approved unpaid leave requests and trigger automatic pay deduction creation. ; The feature interacts with the payroll system to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table. ; The feature depends on the public holiday calendar configuration to accurately adjust working days for daily pay calculation. ; The feature relies on employee records system to retrieve salary information (Basic + Allowance) for calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Daily Wage Calculator interacts with Payroll settings, the company's public holiday calendar (required for working days calculations), and impacts three downstream payroll processes: salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Daily Wage Calculator (DWC) interacts with the Payroll system and affects active payroll table transactions, employee first salary calculations, and end-of-service settlements.
