The issue is that I'm in a different directory (`/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides`) than where the MCP configuration exists (`/Users/mashapa/user-guides/.mcp.json`). 

Based on the instructions you've provided and the situation, I need to inform you about the current state:

## Current Status

❌ **Critical Blocker Identified**: Playwright MCP server is not accessible from the current working directory.

### The Problem:
- MCP configuration exists at: `/Users/mashapa/user-guides/.mcp.json`
- Current working directory: `/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides`
- MCP servers are loaded from the working directory's configuration
- Playwright MCP tools are not available in this session

### What This Means:
I cannot perform the automated UI validation as specified because I need Playwright MCP to:
- Launch and control a browser
- Navigate to app.bayzat.com
- Authenticate with credentials
- Interact with UI elements
- Capture screenshots
- Verify UI states and components

### Solutions:

**Option 1: Copy MCP Configuration** (Recommended)
Copy the `.mcp.json` file to the current validation directory so Playwright MCP is available.

**Option 2: Run from Different Directory**
Execute the validation from `/Users/mashapa/user-guides/` where MCP is configured.

**Option 3: Manual Validation Report**
I can create a template validation report based on the requirements that you can fill in manually after performing the UI checks.

Which approach would you like me to take?
