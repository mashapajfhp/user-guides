I notice that the Playwright MCP server isn't loading as expected. Based on the git log I can see from the initial context, there were recent commits about adding MCP config for Playwright. Let me check if there's a way to manually start the validation or if I should document that the MCP server needs to be properly initialized.

Looking at the situation, I need to inform you about a critical issue:

## ⚠️ Critical Issue: Playwright MCP Server Not Available

The validation request requires browser automation to:
1. Navigate to https://app.bayzat.com/
2. Authenticate with the provided credentials
3. Explore and validate 9 different UI plans with 29 total checks
4. Capture deterministic screenshots
5. Document all UI interactions

**Current Status:**
- MCP configuration exists at `.mcp.json` ✅
- Node.js and npx are available ✅  
- Playwright MCP server is **NOT connected** ❌

**What's needed:**
The Playwright MCP server must be started and connected before I can perform the browser-based validation. This appears to be an infrastructure issue with how the MCP server is being loaded.

**Recent git commits suggest this is a known issue:**
- `194bd30 trigger: re-run v6 validation with MCP config`
- `e711dcb fix: add --mcp-config flag to load Playwright MCP`

**Options:**
1. **Restart Claude Code with MCP server properly loaded** - The MCP server needs to be initialized when Claude Code starts
2. **Manual validation** - Someone performs the validation manually and I document their findings
3. **Alternative automation** - Use a different browser automation approach (though this would require significant rework)

Would you like me to:
- A) Create a detailed manual validation checklist that a human can follow?
- B) Wait for the MCP server to be properly initialized and retry?
- C) Attempt an alternative approach using available tools?
