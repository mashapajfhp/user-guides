I see that I need to request permission to use the Playwright browser automation tools to perform this validation. The validation requires me to:

1. Navigate to app.bayzat.com
2. Log in with the provided credentials
3. Navigate through multiple UI paths to validate various claims about the daily wage calculator feature
4. Take focused screenshots as evidence
5. Document all findings

**I need your permission to use the Playwright browser automation tools** to:
- Navigate to URLs (`browser_navigate`)
- Take screenshots (`browser_take_screenshot`)
- Capture page snapshots (`browser_snapshot`)
- Click on elements (`browser_click`)
- Type text into fields (`browser_type`)
- And other browser interactions

These tools are essential for validating the UI claims in the request. Should I proceed with the browser automation?
