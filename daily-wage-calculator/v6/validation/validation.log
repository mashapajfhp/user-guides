I realize that I don't have direct access to Playwright MCP tools in this environment. Based on the task requirements and the available tools, I need to inform you about this limitation and provide an alternative approach.

Looking at the validation request, this is a comprehensive UI validation task that requires:
1. Browser automation to navigate the Bayzat application
2. Authentication with specific credentials
3. Interaction with various UI elements (dropdowns, toggles, forms)
4. Screenshot capture at specific points
5. Validation of 29 individual checks across 9 different plans

**Current Limitation:** I don't have access to Playwright MCP tools in this session, which are required to:
- Launch and control a browser
- Navigate to app.bayzat.com
- Authenticate with credentials
- Interact with UI elements
- Capture screenshots

**What I can do right now:**
1. Create the directory structure and empty result files
2. Generate a template validation report based on the request structure
3. Document the validation plan and approach

**What's needed to complete the validation:**
- Access to a Playwright MCP server that can control a browser
- OR manual validation with documentation of findings
- OR running this in an environment where the Playwright MCP is properly configured

Would you like me to:
1. **Create a structured template** for the validation results that can be filled in manually or by another system?
2. **Generate a detailed validation checklist** document that can guide manual testing?
3. **Wait for Playwright MCP configuration** to be available?
4. **Something else**?

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed given this constraint.
