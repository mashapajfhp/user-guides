  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table based on the calculated daily pay rate.

- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee; the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) must be configured for the organization.
- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to accurately exclude public holidays when using the working days calculation base.
- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator.
- Access to Leave Settings with Super Admin permissions to add or modify leave policies
- Super admin role and access to payroll configuration settings

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowances), number of working days in the month, number of public holidays in the month, and the approved unpaid leave days.
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and selection of salary components to include (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and eligible leave types for encashment configuration.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days) when configuring unpaid leave deductions
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction amount reflected on the payroll table; calculated daily pay rate used to determine the salary reduction for unpaid leave.
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and determines which salary components and calculation methods apply to leave encashment.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation settings that determine how daily deductions are applied to monthly employee pay
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request; approve the leave request; determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days); calculate total working days in the month; subtract public holidays from working days to arrive at actual working days; calculate daily pay by dividing salary amount (basic plus allowance) by actual working days; generate automatic payroll deduction.
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the desired calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose which salary components to factor into calculations.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (calendar days, working days, or custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types eligible for encashment in end-of-service calculations.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select Unpaid leave option, choose calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select day calculation type (calendar days, working days, or custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay formula: Salary Amount (Basic + Allowance) / Number of actual working days in the month. Leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to determine actual working days used in the calculation.
- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible basis set by company policy). Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to align with labor law requirements.
- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method selection is limited to three options: calendar days, working days, or custom days. Leave encashment configuration affects end-of-service calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected when configuring the policy
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration settings

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from the working days total before calculating daily pay. For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22 days.
- Calculation varies depending on month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), and different calculation methods can significantly impact final wage calculations for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
- Super admins can view which existing eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten when configuring new leave encashment settings.
- Multiple options are available for daily rate calculation including Basic Only and Basic + Allowances, providing flexibility in how unpaid leave impacts compensation
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new salary proration settings

- Interacts with the payroll system by calculating daily deductions that are applied to monthly employee pay; integrates with Leave Policies configuration
- Interacts with Payroll system and payroll table; affects active payroll transactions and employee compensation calculations
