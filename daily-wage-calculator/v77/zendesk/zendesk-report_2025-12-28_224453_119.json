    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table based on the calculated daily pay rate."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculation accounts for the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working days. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system automatically generates a pay deduction reflected on the payroll table based on the calculated daily pay rate.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages, including salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions, with options to select calculation bases and salary components. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Allow super admins to configure and customize leave encashment policies for end-of-service calculations, including selection of applicable salary components and calculation methods. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Calculate and manage unpaid leave deductions on a daily basis to be set off against the employee's monthly pay [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Primary Personas\n- HR personnel and payroll administrators responsible for managing employee leave and salary calculations. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Superadmin, Payroll table managers, and transaction processors who configure and manage daily wage calculations. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins responsible for payroll and HR settings configuration. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Super Admins who configure leave policies and unpaid leave deduction calculations [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Super admin users who manage payroll configuration and salary proration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Navigation Paths\n- Access the Daily Wage Calculator from Settings → Payroll → Daily Wage Calculation. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Access the Daily Wage Calculator via Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Prerequisites\n- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee; the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) must be configured for the organization. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Company's public holiday calendar must be set up to accurately exclude public holidays when using the working days calculation base. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Access to Leave Settings with Super Admin permissions to add or modify leave policies [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Super admin role and access to payroll configuration settings [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Required Inputs\n- Employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowances), number of working days in the month, number of public holidays in the month, and the approved unpaid leave days.

Leave policy can be based on calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days). Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working days count to determine actual working days used in the calculation. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation can be based on calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (flexible basis set by company policy).

For example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with 22 working days, the daily pay calculation uses 20 days instead of 22 days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation varies depending on month length (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), and different calculation methods can significantly impact final wage calculations for salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deductions.
