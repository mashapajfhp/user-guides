    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees who take unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days). The feature automatically generates pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. A critical aspect of the calculation is the deduction of public holidays from the working day count, ensuring that statutory holidays are not counted as billable working days. This feature integrates with the leave management system to process approved unpaid leave requests and automatically apply the corresponding salary reductions. The daily wage calculator ensures consistent, policy-compliant salary deductions across the organization and reduces manual payroll processing errors. It serves as a bridge between leave management and payroll systems, enabling HR and payroll administrators to efficiently manage employee compensation when unpaid leave is taken."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\n  Generated on: 2025-12-24\n\n  ## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\n  The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees who take unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days). The feature automatically generates pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. A critical aspect of the calculation is the deduction of public holidays from the working day count, ensuring that statutory holidays are not counted as billable working days. This feature integrates with the leave management system to process approved unpaid leave requests and automatically apply the corresponding salary reductions. The daily wage calculator ensures consistent, policy-compliant salary deductions across the organization and reduces manual payroll processing errors. It serves as a bridge between leave management and payroll systems, enabling HR and payroll administrators to efficiently manage employee compensation when unpaid leave is taken.\n\n  ## Observed Jobs
