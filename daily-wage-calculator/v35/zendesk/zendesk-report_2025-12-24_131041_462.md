  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-24  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees who take unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing an employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowances) by the number of actual working days in the month, accounting for the organization's leave policy (calendar days or working days). The feature automatically generates pay deductions that are reflected on the payroll table upon approval of unpaid leave requests. A critical aspect of the calculation is the deduction of public holidays from the working day count, ensuring that statutory holidays are not counted as billable working days. This feature integrates with the leave management system to process approved unpaid leave requests and automatically apply the corresponding salary reductions. The daily wage calculator ensures consistent, policy-compliant salary deductions across the organization and reduces manual payroll processing errors. It serves as a bridge between leave management and payroll systems, enabling HR and payroll administrators to efficiently manage employee compensation when unpaid leave is taken.

## Knowledge Extract

### Job to be done

- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days
- Automatically generate pay deductions upon approval of unpaid leave requests and reflect them on the payroll table
- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked

### Primary personas

- HR personnel responsible for managing employee leave and processing leave requests
- Payroll administrators responsible for salary calculations and payroll processing
- Super admin

### Key actions and steps

_None_

### Navigation paths

- Leave Management System → Unpaid Leave Request → Approval → Payroll Table — _User navigates through leave management to approve unpaid leave, which triggers automatic daily pay calculation and deduction_
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation — _Primary navigation path to access daily wage calculator configuration_

### Prerequisites

- Unpaid leave request must be submitted and approved before daily pay deduction is calculated
- Employee must have a defined leave policy (either calendar days or working days based)
- Organization must have public holidays defined in the system for the relevant month
- Super admin role or equivalent permissions

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary amount (Basic + Allowance) — _The complete salary figure including base salary and any allowances, used as the numerator in the daily pay calculation_
- Number of actual working days in the month — _The count of working days in the relevant month, which varies based on the leave policy (calendar days or working days) and must be adjusted for public holidays_
- Leave policy type (calendar days or working days) — _Determines whether the calculation uses calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) as the baseline_
- Public holidays falling in the calculation month — _Specific dates of public holidays that must be deducted from the working day count to arrive at actual working days_
- Calculation basis selection — _Super admin must select one of three calculation bases: custom days, calendar days, or working days_

### Outputs and results

- Calculated daily pay rate — _The result of dividing total salary by actual working days, expressed as a monetary amount per day_
- Automatic pay deduction — _A deduction record associated with the specific unpaid leave request, automatically created upon approval_
- Payroll table reflection — _The calculated deduction is automatically reflected on the payroll table for the relevant pay period_
- Updated salary calculations — _Proportionally adjusted employee compensation based on selected calculation method (custom days, calendar days, or working days)_
- Updated payroll table — _Changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table_

### Procedures

- **Calculate Daily Pay for Unpaid Leave Deduction** — _When processing an approved unpaid leave request to determine the salary deduction amount_
  - Receive and approve unpaid leave request
  - Identify the leave policy type (calendar days or working days) for the employee
  - Determine the baseline number of days (e.g., 30 calendar days or 22 working days)
  - Identify all public holidays falling in the month of the unpaid leave
  - Deduct public holidays from the baseline working days to get actual working days
  - Divide employee's total salary (Basic + Allowance) by the actual working days
  - Apply the calculated daily pay rate to the number of unpaid leave days taken
  - Automatically generate the pay deduction record
  - Reflect the deduction on the payroll table
- **Update Salary Proration** — _When adjusting how employee salaries are prorated based on days worked_
  - Navigate to Settings
  - Select Payroll
  - Choose Daily wage calculation
  - Select calculation basis from: custom days, calendar days, or working days
  - Save changes
- **Update Salary Proration During Open Payroll Month** — _When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions have been submitted for one or multiple employees_
  - Reject the transactions with prorated salaries
  - Save the changes for salary proration
  - Confirm new proration settings take effect

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (Basic + Allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month
- The leave policy determines whether calculations use calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days)
- Public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from the working day count to arrive at actual working days
- Daily pay deductions are only created and reflected automatically upon approval of an unpaid leave request
- Changes to salary proration will affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted, Super admin must reject the transactions before saving new proration changes
- Calculation basis options are limited to: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be carefully identified and subtracted from working days; failure to account for public holidays will result in incorrect daily pay calculations
- Different employees may have different leave policies (calendar days vs. working days), requiring the system to apply the correct policy for each employee
- Months with multiple public holidays will have significantly fewer actual working days, which directly impacts the daily pay rate calculation
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist for one or multiple employees, Super admin must manually reject and resave transactions to apply new proration settings
- Changing salary proration affects both first salary and end-of-service settlement calculations, requiring careful consideration of timing

### Feature interactions and dependencies

- Depends on Leave Management System to receive and process unpaid leave requests
- Integrates with Payroll System to automatically create and reflect pay deductions on the payroll table
- Requires Employee Record System to access employee salary information (basic + allowance)
- Depends on Holiday Calendar System to identify public holidays for the calculation month
- Interacts with Payroll system for salary calculations
- Interacts with payroll table to update active (unpaid) amounts
- Depends on prorated salary transaction management when payroll months are open
