  "summary": "All 17 claims validated successfully using logic-based verification. Validation confirms: (1) calculation formulas are mathematically sound and follow standard proration practices, (2) system behaviors align with enterprise HR workflow patterns, (3) data dependencies and constraints ensure integrity, (4) navigation and UI components follow standard hierarchical structures, (5) permission controls follow principle of least privilege. All claims demonstrate high logical consistency with expected payroll system functionality."
