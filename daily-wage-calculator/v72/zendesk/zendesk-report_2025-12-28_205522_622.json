    "description": "The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates and reflects the corresponding pay deduction on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies."

  "markdown_report": "# Zendesk Documentation – daily wage calculator\n\nGenerated on: 2025-12-28\n\n## Feature Overview (From Zendesk articles)\nThe daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates and reflects the corresponding pay deduction on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.\n\n## Observed Jobs To Be Done\n- Calculate and deduct daily pay for employees taking unpaid leave by determining the appropriate salary reduction based on the number of working or calendar days in the month [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Provide a flexible and customizable method for calculating daily wages to determine salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts with greater control over calculation methodology.

Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days; the leave policy can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days); public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days (all days in a month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined). Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with labor law requirements. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method selection is limited to three options: Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Configuration applies to individual leave types for end-of-service calculations. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected when configuring the policy [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must reject existing transactions before saving new proration settings. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Edge Cases & Warnings\n- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the working days when calculating daily pay; for example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working day policy, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days instead of 22 days [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation bases produce different daily wage rates and impact final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Super admins should be aware that their leave encashment policy configurations will overwrite existing eligible paid leave-type policies, which are visible in the configuration interface. [Articles: 14243768433425]\n- Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days), requiring careful selection based on organizational policy [Articles: 14244040988689]\n- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject those transactions with prorated salaries before saving changes to salary proration settings.
