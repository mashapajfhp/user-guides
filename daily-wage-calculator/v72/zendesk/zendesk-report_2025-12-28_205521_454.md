  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-28  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a payroll feature that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees taking unpaid leave. It calculates daily pay by dividing the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The calculation accounts for public holidays by deducting them from the working days total. Once an unpaid leave request is approved, the system automatically generates and reflects the corresponding pay deduction on the payroll table. The feature supports both calendar day-based and working day-based leave policies.

- Allow super admins to configure and customize leave encashment policies for end-of-service calculations, including selection of salary components and calculation methods.
- Calculate and manage unpaid leave deductions on a daily basis to be set off against the employee's monthly pay
- Adjust and calculate an employee's salary proportionally based on the actual days worked, affecting their first salary and end-of-service settlement

### Primary personas

- Settings → Leaves → Leave Policies → Add policy → Unpaid leave selection
- Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation

### Prerequisites

- An approved unpaid leave request must exist for the employee before daily pay deduction can be calculated and reflected
- Company public holiday calendar must be configured to exclude weekends and public holidays from working days calculations.
- User must have super admin role to access and configure the Daily Wage Calculator.
- Access to Leave Settings configuration as a Super Admin; ability to add a new leave policy
- Super admin access to payroll settings; active payroll system with employee records

### Data inputs required

- Employee's total salary (basic salary plus allowance), number of working days in the month, leave policy type (calendar days or working days), and approved unpaid leave days
- Selection of calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days) and salary components to factor into calculations (basic salary, basic salary plus allowances, or allowances only).
- Selection of salary components (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), selection of calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days), and configuration of eligible leave types for encashment.
- Selection of calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances) and day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- Selection of calculation basis: custom days, calendar days, or working days

### Outputs and results

- Automatic pay deduction associated with the unpaid leave request, reflected on the payroll table, and calculated daily pay rate used for the deduction
- Calculated daily wage rates that are applied to salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction calculations.
- Customized leave encashment policy configuration that affects end-of-service calculations and determines which salary components and calculation methods apply to leave encashments.
- Configured unpaid leave deduction calculation method that applies daily deductions to monthly employee payroll
- Updated salary calculations that proportionally adjust employee compensation based on selected calculation method; changes apply to all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table

### Procedures

- Receive unpaid leave request, approve the leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay rate by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction
- Navigate to Settings, select Payroll, choose Daily Wage Calculation, select the calculation base (calendar days, working days, or custom days), and choose salary components to include in the calculation.
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > End of Service eligibility > Configure. 2. Select salary components applicable to leave encashments (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances). 3. Choose calculation method (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days). 4. Configure individual leave types eligible for end-of-service encashment. 5. Review which eligible paid leave-type policies will be overwritten.
- Navigate to Settings, select Leaves, go to Leave Policies, add a new policy, select the Unpaid leave option, choose a calculation method (Basic Only or Basic + Allowances), and select a day calculation type (Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days)
- 1. Navigate to Settings > Payroll > Daily wage calculation. 2. Select calculation basis (custom days, calendar days, or working days). 3. Save changes. 4. If payroll month is open with existing prorated salary transactions, reject those transactions and then save the new proration settings.

### Rules, limitations, constraints

- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days; the leave policy can be calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days); public holidays falling in the month must be deducted from working days to arrive at actual working days
- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days (all days in a month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (company-defined). Most UAE and KSA companies use 30 custom days to comply with labor law requirements.
- Salary component selection is limited to two options: Basic Only or Basic + Allowances. Calculation method selection is limited to three options: Calendar days, Working days, or Custom days. Configuration applies to individual leave types for end-of-service calculations.
- Unpaid leave deductions must be calculated on a daily basis and set off against the employee's monthly pay; calculation method and day type must be selected when configuring the policy
- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, Super admin must reject existing transactions before saving new proration settings.

### Edge cases and warnings

- Public holidays must be considered and subtracted from the working days when calculating daily pay; for example, if 2 public holidays fall in a month with a 22-day working day policy, daily pay is calculated based on 20 days instead of 22 days
- Calendar days vary by month (e.g., 31 days in January, 28 days in February), which affects daily wage calculations. Different calculation bases produce different daily wage rates and impact final salary proration, leave encashment, and unpaid leave deduction amounts.
- Super admins should be aware that their leave encashment policy configurations will overwrite existing eligible paid leave-type policies, which are visible in the configuration interface.
- Multiple calculation method options are available (Basic Only and Basic + Allowances) and multiple day calculation types (Calendar days, Working days, Custom days), requiring careful selection based on organizational policy
- When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject those transactions with prorated salaries before saving changes to salary proration settings.

### Feature interactions and dependencies
