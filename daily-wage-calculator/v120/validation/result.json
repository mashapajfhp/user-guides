  "summary": "All 3 validation claims are logically feasible and can be validated through observable UI indicators. VAL-001 (formula override) is validated via visual state inspection of greyed-out fields and formula text comparison. VAL-002 (salary configuration staleness) is validated via data inspection of timestamps and deduction amounts. VAL-003 (leap year calculation) is validated via mathematical verification of day counts in service period breakdown. All navigation paths are accessible and required UI elements exist in specified locations."
