  # Daily Wage Calculator

**Module area:** Unknown  
**Feature slug:** `daily_wage_calculator`  
**Source:** zendesk  
**Generated at:** 2025-12-26  

## Feature Overview

The daily wage calculator is a system component that automatically computes daily pay deductions for employees who take unpaid leave. It divides the employee's total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month to determine the daily pay rate. The calculator accounts for leave policy type (calendar days or working days) and automatically deducts public holidays from working day counts. Upon approval of an unpaid leave request, the system generates an automatic pay deduction reflected on the payroll table using the calculated daily pay rate.

  - Validation hint: Steps: Receive and approve unpaid leave request, determine the applicable leave policy (calendar days or working days), calculate total working days in the month, subtract public holidays from working days, calculate daily pay by dividing salary by actual working days, and generate the payroll deduction. || Expected: Procedure completes without blocking validation errors | System shows success confirmation (toast/banner) OR state persists after refresh

- **ZDS_004** (ui_presence; risk: low)
  - Claim: UI indicates: Calculation base options are limited to calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (user-defined, commonly set to 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Different calculation bases produce different daily wage amounts.

- **ZDS_005** (ui_presence; risk: low)
  - Claim: UI indicates: Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new salary proration changes.
