If payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions exist, reject the transactions and resave the proration settings to apply the changes. [Articles: 14243760419089]\n\n## Rules / Limitations / Constraints\n- Daily pay is calculated by dividing total salary (basic plus allowance) by the number of actual working days in the month. The leave policy determines whether calendar days (e.g., 30 days) or working days (e.g., 22 days) are used. Public holidays falling in the calculation month are deducted from the working day count to arrive at actual working days. [Articles: 14154746403601]\n- Calculation base options are limited to calendar days (actual days in the month), working days (excluding weekends and public holidays), or custom days (user-defined, commonly set to 30 days in UAE and KSA to comply with labor law). Different calculation bases produce different daily wage amounts. [Articles: 14243704039185]\n- Changes to salary proration affect all active (unpaid) amounts in the payroll table. When payroll month is open and prorated salary transactions are submitted for one or multiple employees, the Super admin must reject those transactions before saving new salary proration changes.
