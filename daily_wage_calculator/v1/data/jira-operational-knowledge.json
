The daily wage calculator is a payroll system function for calculating prorated salary for employees joining mid-month or working partial pay periods. It involves determining salary based on working days, excluding weekends and public holidays, using a formula of (Basic Salary + Allowances) / Total Working Days in Month * Included Working Days. The EOS gratuity calculator computes employee end-of-service benefits based on service period and daily wage. The current system has a critical limitation in handling leap years, specifically miscalculating total service days when an employee's tenure spans a leap year. This results in potential underpayment of gratuity benefits due to incorrect day counting logic. The daily wage calculator is a payroll system feature that determines salary proration based on an employee's configured work week. Customers seek accurate calculation of proportional salary by counting working days according to the specific work week configuration. The system calculates proration dynamically, considering whether all days or specific days are marked as working days in an employee's work week setup. The daily wage calculator involves calculating an employee's prorated salary when they work only part of a month, such as during mid-month termination. The system calculates daily wage by dividing total monthly salary by total working days in the month, then multiplying by actual days worked, excluding weekends and holidays. The daily wage calculator is a payroll system function used to calculate precise wage deductions for periods of unpaid leave. It uses a configured divisor (30.42 days) instead of calendar days to compute daily wage rates, which can result in deduction amounts that may differ from expected monthly salary. The system enables prorated salary calculations based on configured leave policy settings. The daily wage calculator is a payroll system component used to calculate salary deductions for unpaid leave by determining an employee's daily wage rate.
