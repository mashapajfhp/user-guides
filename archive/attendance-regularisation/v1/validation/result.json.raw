The validation has been completed with the following outcome:

**Status: BLOCKED**

**Summary:**
- ✅ Login successful
- ✅ Dashboard loaded
- ❌ Feature not accessible - navigation blocked

**Issues Encountered:**
1. **Navigation Failure**: Unable to navigate from Home dashboard to the Time section despite multiple attempts using different approaches
2. **Onboarding Modal**: A tour modal appeared on dashboard load which may have interfered with sidebar interaction
3. **Screenshot Timeouts**: Screenshot operations consistently timed out, limiting visual documentation

**What Was Completed:**
- Successfully logged in to the application
- Reached the Home dashboard
- Identified sidebar menu structure (Home, Company, Payroll, Finance Ops, Time, Performance, Health, Requests, Insights, Automations, Settings)

**Blocking Factor:**
The automated navigation using Playwright's JavaScript click events did not trigger the single-page application's routing to the Time section. This appears to be a limitation when interacting with complex React/SPA applications where programmatic clicks don't properly trigger framework-level navigation events.

**Recommendation:**
Manual exploration of the Bayzat application will be required to:
1. Navigate to Time → Attendance Regularisation
2. Document the feature's UI, workflows, and functionality
3. Capture screenshots for user guide creation
