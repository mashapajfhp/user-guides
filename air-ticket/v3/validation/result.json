Employees are listed by name only without any indication of available air ticket requests (no '0/1' notation or 'X available' text). This validates that the ambiguous '0/1' notation mentioned in tickets AV-6477 and AV-6343 is not currently visible in the dropdown - the balance information is simply not shown during employee selection."
