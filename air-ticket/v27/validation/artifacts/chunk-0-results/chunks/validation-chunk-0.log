## Critical Environment Issue Detected

I've identified a critical blocker that prevents me from executing the UI validation tests:

### Issue
**Playwright MCP tools are not available in the current agent environment.**

### Expected Tools (Missing)
According to the validation prompt instructions, I should have access to:
- `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`
- `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot`
- `mcp__playwright__browser_click`
- `mcp__playwright__browser_fill`
- `mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for`
- And other Playwright MCP browser automation tools

### Available MCP Tools (Current)
I only have access to:
- Slack MCP tools
- N8N webhook MCP tools
- Zendesk MCP tools
- Composio Jira MCP tools

### Configuration Status
The `.mcp.json` file shows Playwright is configured:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@0.0.42", ...]
    }
  }
}
```

However, the Playwright MCP server appears to not be running or not properly integrated with the agent environment.

### Impact
**Cannot execute any UI validation tests** because:
1. Cannot navigate to the application URL
2. Cannot interact with UI elements (click, fill, scroll)
3. Cannot capture screenshots for evidence
4. Cannot validate visual elements or workflows

### Previous Run Analysis
Looking at the existing `result-chunk-0.json` file, I can see that a previous validation attempt encountered the same issues:
- 3 out of 4 tests were "skipped" due to navigation failures
- Only 1 test showed "passed" status but with limited validation
- Screenshots exist but tests could not complete full workflows

### Recommendation
This validation run cannot proceed without resolving the Playwright MCP integration issue. The system needs:

1. **Playwright MCP server to be started and connected**
2. **Agent environment to have access to Playwright MCP tools**
3. **Verification that browser automation is functional**

Would you like me to:
1. Attempt to troubleshoot the Playwright MCP integration?
2. Document the current state in detail for the engineering team?
3. Wait for the environment to be properly configured before proceeding?
