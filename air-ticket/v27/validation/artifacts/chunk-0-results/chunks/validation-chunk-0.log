^DThe MCP configuration exists but the Playwright tools are not available. This suggests the MCP server needs to be restarted or the connection is not established. Let me create a comprehensive validation summary:

## Validation Chunk-0 Execution Summary

### Status: FAILED - Playwright MCP Not Available

I've attempted to execute the Air Ticket validation tests for chunk-0, but the validation cannot proceed because **Playwright MCP tools are not accessible** in the current environment.

### What Was Done:
1. ✅ Successfully read and parsed the validation payload from `/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/air-ticket/v27/validation/validation-payload.json`
2. ✅ Successfully resolved all reference IDs from the definitions section
3. ✅ Created directory structure for screenshots and results
4. ✅ Updated the result file with current timestamp and detailed information
5. ❌ Cannot execute browser automation tests (Playwright tools missing)

### Test Coverage Attempted:
- **Total Tests:** 4
- **Passed:** 0
- **Failed:** 0
- **Skipped:** 4 (due to missing Playwright MCP)

### Tests Ready for Execution:
1. **TEST-TSSD-3193:** Client is unable to remove Processed Air tickets (workflow test)
2. **TEST-AV-6477:** Show remaining air tickets when balance is on hold (UI visibility test)
3. **TEST-AV-6343:** Unclear indication of available air ticket requests (text verification test)
4. **TEST-TSSD-3366:** Need to remove processed Air tickets with Payroll reopen (workflow test)

### Reference Resolution:
All reference IDs were successfully resolved:
- **Access Paths:** CFG-001, CFG-002
- **Setup Flows:** SETUP-001 (11 steps), SETUP-002 (11 steps)
- **Business Rules:** 10 rules identified
- **Edge Cases:** 7 edge cases identified
- **UI Elements:** 20 UI elements mapped

### Issue Details:
**Problem:** Playwright MCP server is configured in `.mcp.json` but the MCP tools are not accessible in the current Claude Code session.

**Configuration Found:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@0.0.42", "--output-dir", "...", "--browser", "chrome", "--timeout", "300000"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Resolution Steps:
1. **Restart Claude Code** to reload MCP configuration
2. Verify Playwright MCP package: `npx -y @playwright/mcp@0.0.42 --help`
3. Check MCP server logs for connection errors
4. Ensure `.mcp.json` is properly formatted (it is)
5. Re-run this validation after MCP server is connected

### Output Files:
- **Result JSON:** `/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/air-ticket/v27/validation/chunks/results/result-chunk-0.json`
- **Screenshots Directory:** `/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/air-ticket/v27/validation/screenshots/chunk-0/` (empty - no tests executed)

The validation infrastructure is ready and all test data is properly parsed. The tests just need the Playwright MCP server to be connected to execute the browser automation.
