I've completed the analysis and created the required output files. Here's what I found:

## Validation Status: Failed (Missing Playwright MCP)

I successfully:
1. Created the chunk-0.json file with all 4 tests from the validation payload
2. Created the screenshots directory structure
3. Analyzed all test requirements and resolved their references

However, I cannot execute the actual UI validation tests because:

**Missing Capability**: This task requires **Playwright MCP browser automation** to interact with the live Bayzat application at https://app.bayzat.com/. The current environment does not have Playwright MCP tools available.

### What the tests require:
- **TEST-TSSD-3193**: Validate air ticket deletion workflow after payroll transaction rejection
- **TEST-AV-6477**: Verify remaining balance visibility during pending booking requests  
- **TEST-AV-6343**: Confirm clear indication of available vs used air ticket requests
- **TEST-TSSD-3366**: Test cross-period air ticket encashment movement via payroll reopen

### Files created:
- `/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/air-ticket/v27/validation/chunks/chunk-0.json` - Test definitions
- `/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/air-ticket/v27/validation/chunks/results/result-chunk-0.json` - Results with error details
- Screenshot directory structure (empty, awaiting browser automation)

### To complete this validation:
You need to configure Playwright MCP integration in your environment to enable browser automation capabilities. Once available, the validation can be re-run to execute the actual UI tests.
