### Key Issues
Most tests were skipped due to navigation failures, likely due to:
- Missing permissions for the test account
- UI structure changes in Settings > Workflows and Air ticket policies sections
- Test account may not have admin/configuration access

The validation captured evidence of navigation issues which will help identify permission or access problems for future runs.
