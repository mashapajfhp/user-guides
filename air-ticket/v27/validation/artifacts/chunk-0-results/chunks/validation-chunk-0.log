The MCP configuration shows that Playwright should be available, but I don't see the Playwright tools in my available function list. This might be because the MCP server needs to be restarted or the configuration needs to be reloaded.

Let me try a different approach - I'll use the Task tool to delegate this work to an agent that has access to the appropriate tools for browser automation:

Given the complexity of this UI validation task and the need for Playwright automation, I should provide you with a status update:

## Status Update

I've successfully:
1. ✅ Read the validation payload with all 4 tests
2. ✅ Created necessary directory structure for screenshots and results
3. ✅ Set up task tracking for all validation steps

## Issue Identified

The validation payload requires **Playwright browser automation** to execute the UI tests. While the `.mcp.json` configuration file shows Playwright MCP server is configured, I don't currently have access to Playwright tools in this session.

## Required Actions

To execute this chunk validation, one of the following is needed:

### Option 1: Restart with Playwright MCP
The session needs to be restarted with the Playwright MCP server active to gain access to browser automation tools like:
- `playwright_navigate`
- `playwright_click`
- `playwright_fill`
- `playwright_screenshot`
- etc.

### Option 2: Manual Validation
I can provide you with a detailed validation script that you can execute manually or through another automation tool.

### Option 3: Alternative Approach
I could generate a comprehensive test plan document outlining:
- Exact navigation steps for each test
- Expected UI elements to verify
- Assertions to check
- Screenshot capture points

Which approach would you prefer to proceed with?
