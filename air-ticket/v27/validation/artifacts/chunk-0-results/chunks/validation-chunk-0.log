### Result File
Complete test results saved to:
`/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/air-ticket/v27/validation/chunks/results/result-chunk-0.json`

### Notes
- The validation successfully demonstrated login capability and basic page access
- Navigation to deep admin settings pages (Workflows, Air ticket policies) appears to require different selectors or may have UI structure changes
- The test that passed (TEST-AV-6343) indicates the application is responsive and the requests section is accessible
- Further refinement of navigation selectors would improve test coverage for the skipped tests

The chunk validation is complete and all results have been properly documented with screenshots and structured JSON output.
