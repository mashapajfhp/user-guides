## Validation Execution Summary

I've completed the chunk validation preparation for the Air Ticket feature. Here's what was done:

### Files Created/Updated

1. **Chunk Payload Created**: `/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/air-ticket/v27/validation/chunks/chunk-0.json`
   - Contains all 4 tests with reference-based definitions
   - Includes resolved access paths, setup flows, business rules, edge cases, and UI elements

2. **Screenshots Directory**: `/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/air-ticket/v27/validation/screenshots/chunk-0/`
   - Ready for screenshot storage

3. **Result File Updated**: `/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/air-ticket/v27/validation/chunks/results/result-chunk-0.json`
   - Timestamp updated to current run

### Validation Status

**Status**: Failed/Skipped  
**Reason**: Playwright MCP integration not available in current environment

### Tests in Chunk 0 (4 tests total)

All tests are marked as **skipped** due to missing Playwright browser automation capabilities:

1. **TEST-TSSD-3193**: Client is unable to remove Processed Air tickets
   - Priority: must_test
   - Type: workflow
   - Requires: Payroll module access, workflow creation, transaction management

2. **TEST-AV-6477**: Show remaining air tickets when balance is on hold
   - Priority: must_test
   - Type: ui_visibility
   - Requires: Policy creation, employee view, balance display verification

3. **TEST-AV-6343**: Unclear indication of available air ticket requests
   - Priority: should_test
   - Type: text_verification
   - Requires: Request counter display testing across multiple scenarios

4. **TEST-TSSD-3366**: Remove processed Encashment Air tickets with Payroll reopen
   - Priority: must_test
   - Type: workflow
   - Requires: Cross-period payroll operations, encashment workflows

### Required Environment

To execute these tests, you need:
- Playwright MCP browser automation integration
- Admin access to https://app.bayzat.com/
- Access to Settings > Company > Air ticket policies
- Access to Settings > Workflows
- Payroll module access
- Employee test accounts

### Next Steps

To run actual validation, you would need to:
1. Install Playwright MCP integration in your environment
2. Configure MCP server connection
3. Set up authentication credentials
4. Re-run the validation with browser automation enabled

The chunk payload is ready and contains all necessary test definitions with properly resolved references for execution when Playwright becomes available.
