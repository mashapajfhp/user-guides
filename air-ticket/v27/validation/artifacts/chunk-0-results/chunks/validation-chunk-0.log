I can see that a previous validation attempt has already been completed. Looking at the results:

**Validation Summary:**
- **Status**: Completed
- **Total Tests**: 4
- **Passed**: 1 (TEST-AV-6343)
- **Failed**: 0
- **Skipped**: 3 (due to navigation failures)

**Test Results:**
1. **TEST-TSSD-3193** (Air ticket deletion workflow) - Skipped: Failed to navigate to Settings > Workflows
2. **TEST-AV-6477** (Balance visibility during booking) - Skipped: Failed to navigate to Air ticket policies
3. **TEST-AV-6343** (Request display clarity) - **PASSED**: Request display page accessible, 2 of 4 assertions verified
4. **TEST-TSSD-3366** (Cross-period encashment movement) - Skipped: Failed to navigate to Settings > Workflows

**Key Observations:**
- The previous validation run encountered navigation issues preventing access to Settings > Workflows and Air ticket policies
- Only 1 test passed, but 3 tests were skipped rather than exhaustively explored (violates the ZERO-SKIP POLICY)
- Screenshots were captured for each attempt

According to the instructions, I should have the Playwright MCP tools available, but they're not currently loaded in my session. The previous validation attempt also seemed to struggle with navigation.

**Current Situation:**
The validation has already been attempted and a result file exists. However, the results show that 3 out of 4 tests were skipped due to navigation failures, which violates the ZERO-SKIP POLICY and DEEP EXPLORATION PROTOCOL requirements.

Would you like me to:
1. Re-run the validation with a fresh attempt following the Deep Exploration Protocol more thoroughly?
2. Analyze the existing results and provide recommendations?
3. Wait for the Playwright MCP server to be properly initialized first?

The critical issue is that without Playwright MCP tools currently available in my session, I cannot perform the browser automation needed to re-validate these tests.
