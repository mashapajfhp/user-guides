## Validation Run Summary

The UI validation for **Air Ticket feature (v27)** has completed with the following status:

### ❌ Validation Status: FAILED
**Reason:** Playwright MCP tools not accessible

### 📊 Results Summary
- **Total Tests:** 4
- **Passed:** 0
- **Failed:** 0  
- **Skipped:** 4

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The validation agent was invoked correctly with:
- ✅ Valid test payload with 4 comprehensive test cases
- ✅ All reference definitions properly structured (11 business rules, 7 edge cases, 20 UI elements)
- ✅ 2 complete setup flows with detailed steps
- ✅ Authentication credentials provided

**However:**
- ❌ Playwright MCP server is configured in `.mcp.json` but tools are not available in the execution environment
- ❌ Without Playwright tools (`playwright_navigate`, `playwright_click`, `playwright_fill`, `playwright_screenshot`, etc.), browser automation is impossible

### 📝 Tests That Were Skipped

1. **TEST-TSSD-3193** - Processed air ticket deletion workflow validation
2. **TEST-AV-6477** - Air ticket balance visibility during booking  
3. **TEST-AV-6343** - Air ticket request display clarity
4. **TEST-TSSD-3366** - Cross-period encashment movement workflow

### 💡 Resolution Required

To successfully run these validation tests, you need to:

1. **Verify Playwright MCP is running** - Check if the MCP server is connected
2. **Restart Claude Code** - Reload MCP configuration to ensure Playwright tools are registered
3. **Check MCP logs** - Look for any initialization or connection errors
4. **Alternative approach** - Consider using the `journey-validator-n8n` agent which may have proper Playwright integration

The validation infrastructure is correctly set up, but requires a working Playwright MCP connection to execute the actual UI tests.
