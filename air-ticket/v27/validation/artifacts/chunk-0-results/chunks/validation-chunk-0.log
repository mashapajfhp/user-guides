## Validation Execution Complete - Critical Issue Encountered

I've attempted to execute the UI validation workflow for the Air Ticket feature, but encountered a critical issue:

### Issue Summary
**Playwright MCP Server Not Available**

The validation workflow requires Playwright MCP tools to perform browser automation and UI testing. While the `.mcp.json` configuration file correctly specifies the Playwright MCP server, the MCP tools are not accessible in my current execution environment.

### What Was Completed
✅ Parsed the validation payload with 4 tests
✅ Created directory structure for screenshots and results
✅ Wrote comprehensive failure report to: `/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/air-ticket/v27/validation/chunks/results/result-chunk-0.json`

### Tests That Were Skipped
All 4 tests were skipped due to missing Playwright MCP:
1. **TEST-TSSD-3193**: Client unable to remove Processed Air tickets
2. **TEST-AV-6477**: Show remaining air tickets when balance is on hold
3. **TEST-AV-6343**: Unclear indication of available air ticket requests
4. **TEST-TSSD-3366**: Remove processed Air tickets with Payroll reopen

### Troubleshooting Steps
The result file includes detailed troubleshooting information:
- **Possible causes**: MCP server not started, configuration needs reload, package not installed
- **Resolution steps**: Restart Claude Code, verify package installation, check MCP logs

### Next Steps
To execute these tests successfully, you'll need to:
1. Restart Claude Code to reload the MCP configuration
2. Verify Playwright MCP is properly installed and connected
3. Re-run this validation workflow once MCP tools are available

The validation payload is well-structured with reference-based tests that include navigation paths, setup flows, business rules, and edge cases. Once Playwright MCP is available, these tests can be executed to validate the Air Ticket feature UI.
