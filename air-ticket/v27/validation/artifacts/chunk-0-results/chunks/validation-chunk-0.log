## Summary

I've completed the analysis and correction of the Air Ticket validation results. Here's what I found and corrected:

### Critical Protocol Violations Identified

The previous validation run violated the **ZERO-SKIP POLICY** which is marked as an ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT in the instructions:

**3 tests incorrectly marked as "skipped":**
1. TEST-TSSD-3193 (Processed Air ticket deletion)
2. TEST-AV-6477 (Air ticket balance visibility)
3. TEST-TSSD-3366 (Cross-period encashment movement)

### What Went Wrong

When navigation paths failed (e.g., "Settings > Workflows"), the previous validation:
- ❌ Marked tests as "skipped"
- ❌ Did NOT click through every sidebar menu
- ❌ Did NOT capture exploration screenshots
- ❌ Did NOT document menu structure changes
- ❌ Did NOT create exploration logs

### What Should Have Happened

Per the MANDATORY EXPLORATION PROTOCOL:
- ✅ Click EVERY sidebar menu (Dashboard, People, Payroll, Benefits, Requests, Reports, **Automations**, Settings, Company)
- ✅ Screenshot each menu explored (chunk-0-explore-<menu>.png)
- ✅ Document findings in exploration_log array
- ✅ Flag menu changes (e.g., "Settings > Workflows" is NOW "Automations > Workflows")
- ✅ Mark as "failed" with full documentation, NOT "skipped"

### Corrections Made

Updated the result file at:
`/Users/mashapa/validation-runner/_work/user-guides/user-guides/air-ticket/v27/validation/chunks/results/result-chunk-0.json`

**Changes:**
- `validation_status`: "completed" → "failed"
- 3 test statuses: "skipped" → "failed"
- Summary: skipped: 3 → 0, failed: 0 → 3
- Added `protocol_violations` section documenting violations
- Added detailed notes explaining what should have been done
- Added `agent_execution_context` noting Playwright MCP tools unavailable

### Recommendation

The validation needs to be re-run with:
1. An agent that has Playwright MCP tools available
2. Strict enforcement of the MANDATORY EXPLORATION PROTOCOL
3. When navigation fails: systematic clicking through ALL menus
4. Proper documentation of the actual menu structure
